 <p>Having a robust online presence is crucial for attracting potential clients. A well-designed website can serve as the backbone of your marketing efforts, showcasing your properties, expertise, and brand. However, not all real estate websites are created equal. To stand out, you need to incorporate essential features that enhance user experience, improve engagement, and ultimately drive conversions. In this article, we will explore seven must-have features for real estate websites that can help you achieve your business goals.</p>
 <h2>1. User-Friendly Property Search</h2>

 <p>One of the primary functions of a real estate website is to enable visitors to find properties that meet their needs. A user-friendly property search feature is essential. This should include:
