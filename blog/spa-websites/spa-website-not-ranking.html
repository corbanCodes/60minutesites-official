This article will delve into the common reasons why your spa website isn't ranking on Google and provide actionable solutions to improve your online presence. Understanding SEO and implementing effective strategies can transform your website into a powerful marketing tool.</p>
 <h2>Understanding Google's Ranking Factors</h2>

 <p>Google uses a complex algorithm that considers numerous factors to determine the ranking of websites. To improve your spa website's ranking, it is essential to understand these factors, which include:</p>

 <p>1. **Content Quality**: Google prioritizes high-quality, relevant content that answers users' queries.
