 <p>Having a mobile-friendly website is essential for any business, including spas.

 <p>1. **Improved User Experience**: Customers can easily find information and book services on their mobile devices.
2. **Increased Visibility**: Search engines prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their search results, improving your chances of being found.
3. **Higher Conversion Rates**: A seamless mobile experience can lead to more bookings and customer engagement.
4. **Enhanced Customer Trust**: A well-designed mobile site reflects professionalism and builds trust with potential clients.</p>

 <p>To assess whether your spa website is mobile-friendly, you can use tools like Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test.</p>

 <h2>Key Features of a Mobile-Friendly Spa Website</h2>

 <p>To create a mobile-friendly spa website, consider incorporating the following features:</p>
