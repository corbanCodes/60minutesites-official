 <p>Restaurant owners often build websites based on what they think looks impressive rather than what customers actually need. The result is beautiful but frustrating experiences that send hungry visitors to competitors. Understanding what diners want from your website is the first step toward building one that fills tables.</p>

 <p>This checklist covers the 18 elements that matter most to restaurant website visitors. Use it to audit your current site or plan a new one that actually converts visitors into customers.</p>

 <h2>The Complete Restaurant Website Checklist</h2>

 <p>Work through each item and honestly assess your current website. Even implementing half of these properly will put you ahead of most competitors in your area.</p>

 <h3>1. Current Hours Prominently Displayed</h3>

 <p>This is the most common reason people visit restaurant websites, yet many sites bury hours multiple clicks deep or display them in small text that is easy to miss. Your hours should be visible on the homepage without scrolling, in the header or footer of every page, and on a dedicated contact or hours page. Include variations for holidays or special schedules.</p>

 <p>Update hours immediately when they change. Customers who arrive based on website hours only to find you closed will not come back.</p>

 <h3>2. Full Menu with Prices</h3>

 <p>Your menu is why most people visit your website. Display it in HTML format, not as a downloadable PDF. Include prices for every item. Hiding prices raises suspicion and frustrates visitors who are trying to evaluate their options. Organize items logically by category and include descriptions that help customers understand what they are ordering.</p>

 <h3>3. Mobile-Responsive Design</h3>

 <p>Over 70 percent of restaurant website traffic comes from mobile devices. If your site requires zooming, has tiny buttons, or loads slowly on phones, you are losing the majority of potential customers. Test your site on actual phones, navigate the menu, and attempt to order or make a reservation. Any friction you experience will cause visitors to give up.</p>

 <h3>4. Address with Map Integration</h3>

 <p>Display your full address and embed a map that visitors can click to get directions. On mobile, enable tap-to-navigate functionality that opens their preferred maps app. Include parking information if your location requires it, and mention nearby landmarks if your address is difficult to find.</p>

 <h3>5. Tap-to-Call Phone Number</h3>

 <p>Your phone number should be visible on every page and clickable on mobile devices to initiate a call. Many customers still prefer calling for reservations, questions about menu items, or special requests. Do not make them copy and paste your number into their dialer.</p>

 <h3>6. Online Ordering Capability</h3>

 <p>If you offer takeout or delivery, customers expect to order directly from your website. Those who cannot will use third-party apps, costing you commission fees, or simply choose a competitor. Your ordering system should be easy to use, mobile-optimized, and accurately reflect current menu availability.</p>

 <h3>7. Reservation Functionality</h3>

 <p>For restaurants that take reservations, include an easy booking process on your website. Whether you use a third-party platform or handle bookings manually, customers should be able to reserve a table without calling. Include information about party size limits, how far ahead you book, and any deposit requirements for large groups.</p>

 <h3>8. Dietary Information and Allergen Notes</h3>

 <p>Modern diners increasingly have dietary restrictions or preferences. Mark items that are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. Note common allergens. This information is not optional for many customers, and restaurants that provide it earn trust and loyalty from those who need it.</p>

 <h3>9. Clear Cuisine and Concept Description</h3>

 <p>Within seconds of landing on your homepage, visitors should understand what type of restaurant you are. Italian? Mexican? Farm-to-table American? Fine dining or casual? Fast casual or full service? Do not assume visitors know anything about you. State your concept clearly and early.</p>

 <h3>10. Fast Page Load Speed</h3>

 <p>Slow websites lose customers. Every second of load time increases abandonment rates. Restaurant sites often load slowly due to large, unoptimized food photography. Compress images before uploading. Test your speed with Google PageSpeed Insights. Aim for pages that load in under three seconds on mobile connections.</p>

 <h3>11. Current and Accurate Information</h3>

 <p>Outdated menus, old pricing, changed hours, or references to past events signal a restaurant that does not pay attention to details. Review your entire website quarterly at minimum. Establish a process for updating information whenever it changes. Treat website accuracy with the same importance as food quality.</p>

 <h3>12. About Page with Your Story</h3>

 <p>Diners increasingly care about the story behind their food. Share how your restaurant started, your culinary philosophy, chef background, and what makes your approach unique. This builds emotional connection and gives customers reasons to choose you over similar options.</p>

 <h3>13. Quality Food Photography</h3>

 <p>Your food should look appetizing on your website. Poor quality photos make food look unappetizing. Stock photos feel fake. Invest in professional photography of your actual dishes, or learn to take good food photos yourself. Quality visuals drive cravings and orders.</p>

 <h3>14. Social Proof and Reviews</h3>

 <p>Link to your presence on review platforms like Google, Yelp, or TripAdvisor. If you have awards, press mentions, or critic reviews, display them. Social proof helps undecided visitors feel confident choosing your restaurant.</p>

 <h3>15. Catering and Private Event Information</h3>

 <p>If you offer catering or private dining, create dedicated pages for these services. Many restaurants miss additional revenue by not promoting these offerings online. Include menus, pricing guidelines, capacity information, and inquiry forms.</p>

 <h3>16. Gift Card Purchase Option</h3>

 <p>Gift cards represent prepaid revenue and new customer acquisition. If you sell gift cards, make them purchasable online. Physical and digital card options expand your reach and make gift-giving convenient.</p>

 <h3>17. SSL Security Certificate</h3>

 <p>Your website should use HTTPS, shown by the padlock icon in browsers. This is a basic security requirement, especially if you accept online payments. Visitors may not trust entering payment information on insecure sites. Most hosting providers include SSL certificates at no extra cost.</p>

 <h3>18. Contact Form for Inquiries</h3>

 <p>Beyond phone and email, include a contact form for general inquiries, feedback, and special requests. Some customers prefer written communication. Capture enough information to respond helpfully and respond to submissions promptly.</p>

 <h2>Prioritizing Your Improvements</h2>

 <p>If your website is missing multiple items from this checklist, prioritize based on customer impact:</p>

 <p><strong>Fix immediately:</strong> Hours visibility, mobile responsiveness, menu accessibility, phone number. These affect whether visitors can use your site at all.</p>

 <p><strong>High priority:</strong> Online ordering functionality, reservation system, address and directions, page speed. These directly impact conversions and revenue.</p>

 <p><strong>Important:</strong> Dietary information, about page, food photography, accurate content. These influence visitor perception and decision-making.</p>

 <p><strong>Valuable additions:</strong> Gift cards, catering information, social proof, contact forms. These expand functionality and capture additional opportunities.</p>

 <h2>Auditing Your Current Site</h2>

 <p>Visit your own website as a customer would. Try to find the hours. View the menu on your phone. Attempt to place an order or make a reservation. Get directions to your location. Any difficulty you experience multiplies across all your visitors.</p>

 <p>Ask friends or family who are unfamiliar with your website to complete specific tasks and report their experience. Fresh eyes catch problems you have become blind to from familiarity.</p>

 <p>A restaurant website that includes all 18 elements will significantly outperform competitors who treat their online presence as an afterthought. The investment in getting these details right pays off every time a hungry visitor becomes a paying customer.</p>
