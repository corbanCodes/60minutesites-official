 <p>A salon website needs specific pages to serve client needs effectively. Missing pages create gaps in your online presence. Unnecessary pages dilute attention and add maintenance burden. This guide covers the essential pages every salon website should include and exactly what content belongs on each.</p>

 <h2>The Core Pages</h2>

 <p>These pages are non-negotiable for any professional salon website. Each serves a distinct purpose in the client journey from discovery to booking.</p>

 <h3>Homepage</h3>

 <p>Your homepage is the front door to your online presence. Most visitors will land here first, and you have seconds to convince them to explore further or book directly.</p>

 <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Salon name and positioning statement that communicates your specialty or approach</li>
 <li>Location indicator so visitors immediately know you serve their area</li>
 <li>Visual representation of your work quality through curated imagery</li>
 <li>Prominent booking button accessible without scrolling</li>
 <li>Brief overview of what makes your salon distinctive</li>
 <li>Preview of services with link to full menu</li>
 <li>Sample of your best work with link to full gallery</li>
 <li>Quick introduction to your team with link to profiles</li>
 <li>Business hours and contact information</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The homepage should provide enough information for someone to book confidently while offering paths to learn more for those who want deeper information first.</p>

 <h3>Services and Pricing Page</h3>

 <p>This is typically the most visited page after the homepage. Clients want to know what you offer and what it costs before committing to a booking.</p>

 <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Complete list of all services organized by category</li>
 <li>Clear service names that clients understand (minimize jargon)</li>
 <li>Brief descriptions explaining what each service includes</li>
 <li>Pricing for each service or price ranges for variable services</li>
 <li>Approximate duration to help clients plan their time</li>
 <li>Notes on any prerequisites or add-on options</li>
 <li>Booking button or link within easy reach</li>
 </ul>

 <p><strong>Common categories:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Haircuts (women's, men's, children's, specialty cuts)</li>
 <li>Color services (single process, double process, highlights, balayage, corrections)</li>
 <li>Treatments (conditioning, keratin, scalp treatments)</li>
 <li>Styling (blowouts, special occasion, updos, braiding)</li>
 <li>Extensions (installation, maintenance, removal)</li>
 <li>Additional services (brow shaping, makeup, etc.)</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Portfolio or Gallery Page</h3>

 <p>Your work speaks louder than any marketing copy. The gallery demonstrates your capabilities through visual proof of results.</p>

 <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Curated collection of your best work</li>
 <li>Organization by category, style, or technique</li>
 <li>Filter options so visitors can find relevant examples</li>
 <li>Before-and-after transformations where applicable</li>
 <li>Consistent image quality and presentation</li>
 <li>Connection to the stylist who performed the work when relevant</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Quality matters more than quantity. Every image should represent the standard you want to be known for.</p>

 <h3>About Page</h3>

 <p>The about page builds connection and trust by telling your story and sharing your values.</p>

 <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Salon history and founding story</li>
 <li>Philosophy and approach to hair</li>
 <li>What makes your salon different from others</li>
 <li>Specializations or focus areas</li>
 <li>Values that guide how you work with clients</li>
 <li>Awards, recognition, or notable achievements</li>
 <li>Connection to the local community if relevant</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Write in a voice that reflects your salon's personality. A high-end salon sounds different from a casual neighborhood shop. Let authentic character come through.</p>

 <h3>Team or Stylists Page</h3>

 <p>Clients choose stylists, not just salons. Team profiles help clients find the right person for their needs.</p>

 <p><strong>What to include for each team member:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Professional headshot showing personality</li>
 <li>Name and title or role</li>
 <li>Bio covering background, training, and career path</li>
 <li>Specialties and particular skills</li>
 <li>Certifications, advanced training, and education</li>
 <li>Personal interests or fun facts that add dimension</li>
 <li>Link to their individual work samples when available</li>
 <li>Direct booking link for that specific stylist</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Allow personality to show through profiles. Some clients want chatty and social. Others want efficient and focused. Authentic profiles help clients self-select.</p>

 <h3>Contact and Location Page</h3>

 <p>Make it effortless for clients to reach you and find you.</p>

 <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Complete street address</li>
 <li>Embedded map showing your location</li>
 <li>Phone number (tap-to-call on mobile)</li>
 <li>Email address</li>
 <li>Business hours for each day of the week</li>
 <li>Parking information and directions</li>
 <li>Building access instructions if needed</li>
 <li>Contact form for inquiries</li>
 <li>Links to social media profiles</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Booking Page</h3>

 <p>Whether through a dedicated page or integrated booking widget, clients need a clear path to schedule appointments.</p>

 <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Service selection with clear descriptions</li>
 <li>Stylist selection or "next available" option</li>
 <li>Real-time availability calendar</li>
 <li>Appointment confirmation details</li>
 <li>Deposit or card-on-file requirements when applicable</li>
 <li>Cancellation policy reminder</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Recommended Additional Pages</h2>

 <p>Beyond the core pages, these additional pages enhance your site depending on your salon's needs.</p>

 <h3>Policies Page</h3>

 <p>Clear policies set expectations and reduce conflicts. Consider a dedicated page covering:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>Cancellation and rescheduling policy</li>
 <li>Late arrival policy</li>
 <li>Deposit requirements</li>
 <li>Payment methods accepted</li>
 <li>Refund or redo policies</li>
 <li>Health and safety protocols</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>First Visit or New Client Page</h3>

 <p>Address questions and concerns specific to first-time visitors:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>What to expect at the first appointment</li>
 <li>Consultation process explanation</li>
 <li>How to prepare for your appointment</li>
 <li>What information to bring</li>
 <li>How early to arrive</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>FAQ Page</h3>

 <p>Answer common questions clients ask before booking. This reduces phone calls and email while helping visitors make decisions. Cover topics like:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>How to choose the right service</li>
 <li>Color consultation process</li>
 <li>Maintenance expectations for different services</li>
 <li>Product recommendations and retail</li>
 <li>Special occasions and wedding services</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Reviews or Testimonials Page</h3>

 <p>Social proof helps visitors trust your salon. Consider a page featuring client feedback, linking to your Google Business Profile, or showcasing highlights from reviews.</p>

 <h2>Pages You Probably Do Not Need</h2>

 <p>Some pages add more maintenance burden than value. Consider whether you actually need:</p>

 <p><strong>Blog:</strong> Only if you will genuinely maintain it with regular, valuable content. An abandoned blog looks worse than no blog.</p>

 <p><strong>News or Press page:</strong> Unless you have substantial media coverage worth highlighting.</p>

 <p><strong>Separate pages for each service:</strong> Unless SEO strategy specifically requires them, a comprehensive services page usually serves clients better.</p>

 <p><strong>Career or Employment page:</strong> If you rarely hire, this can be a simple contact form addition rather than a full page.</p>

 <h2>Page Structure Principles</h2>

 <p>Regardless of which pages you include, follow these principles:</p>

 <p><strong>Every page should have a purpose.</strong> If you cannot articulate why a page exists and what action visitors should take, reconsider including it.</p>

 <p><strong>Every page should lead somewhere.</strong> Include clear calls-to-action guiding visitors to the next step, whether that is booking, viewing the gallery, or learning about your team.</p>

 <p><strong>Booking should be accessible from everywhere.</strong> The booking button or link should appear on every page, typically in the header.</p>

 <p><strong>Mobile experience matters on every page.</strong> Each page should be designed and tested for mobile visitors, who likely represent the majority of your traffic.</p>
