 <p>Most salon websites have at least one problem that costs them clients. Often, salon owners do not realize these issues exist because they are too familiar with their own site to see it through a visitor's eyes. This guide covers the most common mistakes salon websites make and how to fix them.</p>

 <h2>No Online Booking</h2>

 <p>This is the most damaging mistake a salon website can make. Forcing potential clients to call during business hours to schedule appointments loses bookings to competitors who offer online scheduling.</p>

 <p>Consider when people think about booking salon appointments. Often it is outside business hours, during commutes, late at night, or during moments of downtime. Without online booking, that impulse to schedule cannot be acted on immediately. By the time your phone lines open, they have forgotten, gotten busy, or booked elsewhere.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Add online booking immediately. Multiple platforms offer salon-specific booking with website integration. The investment pays for itself with appointments that would otherwise be lost.</p>

 <h2>Hidden or Missing Prices</h2>

 <p>Some salon owners believe hiding prices encourages clients to call, creating an opportunity to sell. In reality, most visitors who cannot find prices simply leave. They assume hidden prices mean either high costs or unprofessional operations.</p>

 <p>Price transparency actually qualifies visitors. Those who proceed after seeing prices are prepared for the investment. Those who cannot afford your services would have discovered that during consultation anyway, wasting both your time and theirs.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Display prices clearly on your services page. For variable services, show ranges with explanation of what affects cost. Being upfront builds trust and attracts clients who value your work at your prices.</p>

 <h2>Poor Quality Portfolio Images</h2>

 <p>Your portfolio is your most powerful sales tool. Blurry photos, bad lighting, inconsistent backgrounds, or amateur composition suggest amateur work, regardless of actual skill level. Visitors judge your capabilities by the quality of images they see.</p>

 <p>A salon with excellent skills but poor photos loses to a salon with average skills and excellent photos. Visual presentation matters enormously in an industry built on visual results.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Establish standards for portfolio photography. Consistent lighting, clean backgrounds, and thoughtful composition. You do not need professional equipment, but you need consistent quality. Curate ruthlessly, showing only images that represent the standard you want to be known for.</p>

 <h2>Outdated Information</h2>

 <p>Websites showing team members who left years ago, services you no longer offer, or incorrect hours damage credibility. Visitors reasonably question how current any of your information is if obviously outdated content remains.</p>

 <p>Outdated websites also signal neglect. If you cannot maintain your website, visitors might wonder about attention to detail in your actual services.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Audit your website regularly, at least quarterly. Update immediately when staff changes, services change, or business hours change. Remove anything that is no longer accurate.</p>

 <h2>Slow Loading Speed</h2>

 <p>Salon websites with many images can become slow if not optimized. Mobile visitors on cellular networks are especially affected. Every second of delay increases the chance visitors leave before the page finishes loading.</p>

 <p>Slow sites also rank lower in search results, reducing your visibility to potential clients searching for salons in your area.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Optimize images before uploading. Use compression tools to reduce file sizes without visible quality loss. Ensure your hosting can handle your traffic. Test loading speed regularly and address issues promptly.</p>

 <h2>Terrible Mobile Experience</h2>

 <p>Most salon website visitors browse on phones. A site that looks perfect on desktop but is frustrating on mobile alienates the majority of your visitors. Tiny buttons, unreadable text, broken layouts, and slow loading on cellular networks all drive potential clients away.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Test your website on multiple mobile devices. Navigate through the complete user journey on a phone, from finding the site to attempting to book. Fix every friction point you encounter. Consider mobile-first design where mobile experience takes priority.</p>

 <h2>Buried Contact Information</h2>

 <p>Making visitors search for your phone number, address, or contact form creates unnecessary friction. Some visitors will persist, but many will not. They will find a competitor whose contact information is readily available.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Put contact information in the header and footer of every page. Make the phone number tap-to-call on mobile. Include an embedded map on your contact page. Ensure the booking button is always visible.</p>

 <h2>Generic Stock Photos</h2>

 <p>Stock photos of models in salons signal that you do not have real work to show. Visitors want to see your actual results, your actual space, your actual team. Generic imagery creates a generic impression that does nothing to differentiate your salon.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Use only authentic photos of your work, team, and space. Even smartphone photos of real work are more valuable than professional stock images. Build your portfolio systematically by documenting your best results consistently.</p>

 <h2>No Stylist Information</h2>

 <p>Clients choose stylists, not just salons. Websites without individual stylist profiles make it difficult for visitors to feel confident about who they will be working with. They want to know backgrounds, specialties, and see examples of each stylist's work.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Create profiles for every stylist including photo, bio, specialties, and work samples. Let personality come through. Enable booking directly with specific stylists.</p>

 <h2>Confusing Navigation</h2>

 <p>Complex menus, unclear labels, and buried content frustrate visitors trying to find basic information. If people cannot easily find services, prices, or booking, they will not work hard to figure it out. They will leave.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Simplify navigation to essential pages. Use clear, descriptive labels that visitors understand. Keep the most important actions, like booking, prominently accessible from every page. Test navigation with people unfamiliar with your site.</p>

 <h2>Ignoring Local SEO</h2>

 <p>A website that cannot be found in local searches fails at a fundamental purpose. When someone searches for salons in your area, your website should appear. Many salon owners neglect the basic optimization that makes this possible.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Claim and optimize your Google Business Profile. Include your location throughout your website content. Encourage client reviews. Ensure your business name, address, and phone number are consistent across all online platforms.</p>

 <h2>Abandoned Social Links</h2>

 <p>Linking to social media profiles that have not been updated in months or years looks worse than having no social presence at all. It suggests abandonment and raises questions about whether the business is even still operating.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Only link to social platforms you actively maintain. Remove links to dormant profiles. If you cannot commit to maintaining social media, remove the links entirely rather than showcasing neglect.</p>

 <h2>Missing Policies</h2>

 <p>Unclear or missing policies about cancellations, deposits, and other expectations create friction when issues arise. Clear policies set expectations upfront and reduce conflicts later.</p>

 <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Document your policies and display them on your website. Present them clearly but not harshly. The goal is informing clients about expectations, not intimidating them.</p>

 <h2>Auditing Your Site</h2>

 <p>Review your salon website with fresh eyes. Better yet, ask someone unfamiliar with your business to navigate the site and report their experience. Note friction points, confusion, and any difficulty completing common tasks like finding prices or booking an appointment.</p>

 <p>Address the biggest problems first. Often, fixing one or two critical issues dramatically improves conversion rates. Continue improving over time as you identify additional opportunities.</p>

 <p>Your website should work for you around the clock, turning interested visitors into booked clients. Every mistake that remains is an ongoing cost in lost business.</p>
