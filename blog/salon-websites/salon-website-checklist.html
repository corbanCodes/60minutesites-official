        <p>Potential clients arrive at your salon website with specific expectations. They want to see your work, know your prices, learn about your stylists, and book an appointment without friction. Meeting these expectations is the difference between a website that fills your chairs and one that sends visitors to competitors.</p>

        <p>This checklist covers everything clients expect to find on a professional salon website. Use it to audit your current site or plan a new one.</p>

        <h2>The Complete Salon Website Checklist</h2>

        <p>Work through each item and evaluate where your salon website stands. Addressing even half of these elements will put you ahead of most competitors in your area.</p>

        <h3>1. Online Booking Capability</h3>

        <p>Online booking is no longer optional. Clients expect to schedule appointments at any time, not just during business hours. Your website should allow visitors to select a service, choose a stylist, pick a time slot, and confirm their booking without picking up the phone.</p>

        <p>The booking button should be prominent on every page, typically in the header where it remains visible as visitors navigate your site. Integration with platforms like Vagaro, Square Appointments, Fresha, or Booksy provides the functionality clients expect.</p>

        <h3>2. Complete Service Menu with Prices</h3>

        <p>Clients want to know what services you offer and what they cost before booking. Your service menu should list every service with a clear name, brief description, price or price range, and approximate duration.</p>

        <p>Organize services logically by category: haircuts, color services, treatments, styling, extensions, and additional services. Make it easy for clients to find what they are looking for without scrolling through unrelated offerings.</p>

        <h3>3. Portfolio Gallery of Your Work</h3>

        <p>Visual proof of your capabilities is essential. Your gallery should showcase your best work across different service types, hair types, and styles. Include before-and-after transformations, color work, cuts, and special occasion styling.</p>

        <p>Quality matters more than quantity. Fifty stunning images make a stronger impression than two hundred mediocre photos. Curate your gallery to represent the standard you want to be known for.</p>

        <h3>4. Stylist Profiles with Photos</h3>

        <p>Clients choose stylists, not just salons. Each team member should have a profile featuring their photo, background, specialties, certifications, and examples of their work. This helps clients select the right stylist for their needs before booking.</p>

        <p>Include personality in these profiles. Some clients want someone chatty and social. Others prefer a quieter experience. Authentic profiles help clients self-select the right match.</p>

        <h3>5. Contact Information on Every Page</h3>

        <p>Your phone number, address, and email should be accessible from any page, typically in the header or footer. Do not make visitors hunt for basic contact information.</p>

        <p>For mobile visitors, the phone number should be tap-to-call enabled. The address should link to maps for easy navigation. Contact forms should work flawlessly on all devices.</p>

        <h3>6. Business Hours Clearly Displayed</h3>

        <p>Display your hours prominently, including any variations for different days. If individual stylists have different schedules, make that clear in the booking process or on their profiles.</p>

        <p>Update hours immediately when they change, especially for holidays or special events. Nothing frustrates clients more than arriving to find a salon closed when the website said it would be open.</p>

        <h3>7. Location with Directions</h3>

        <p>Include your full street address and an embedded map. Provide parking information, building access details, and any specific instructions for finding your salon, especially if it is in a complex, mall, or multi-story building.</p>

        <p>For mobile users, a tap to open directions in their preferred maps app saves time and reduces confusion.</p>

        <h3>8. Mobile-Responsive Design</h3>

        <p>Most salon website visitors browse on phones. Your site must function flawlessly on mobile devices with easy navigation, readable text without zooming, touch-friendly buttons, and fast loading times.</p>

        <p>Test your website on multiple devices and screen sizes. What works on your computer may be frustrating on a phone. Pay particular attention to how the booking process functions on mobile.</p>

        <h3>9. Fast Loading Speed</h3>

        <p>Salon websites often feature many images, which can slow loading times. Optimize images before uploading and ensure your hosting handles traffic well. Mobile users on cellular networks are especially sensitive to slow sites.</p>

        <p>A few seconds of delay loses visitors. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix loading issues.</p>

        <h3>10. SSL Security Certificate</h3>

        <p>Your website should use HTTPS, indicated by the padlock icon in browsers. This is basic security that protects visitor information and affects search rankings. Most hosting providers include SSL at no extra cost.</p>

        <p>Visitors may not consciously notice HTTPS, but they often notice its absence, especially when entering personal information for bookings.</p>

        <h3>11. Social Media Links</h3>

        <p>Link to your active social media profiles, particularly Instagram where visual content thrives. This allows visitors to see more of your work and follow your salon for updates.</p>

        <p>Only link to platforms you actively maintain. An abandoned social profile with old content looks worse than no profile at all.</p>

        <h3>12. About Page Telling Your Story</h3>

        <p>Share your salon's story, philosophy, and what makes it different. Include information about your approach to hair, the experience clients can expect, and any specializations that set you apart.</p>

        <p>This is where personality matters. Help visitors understand why they should choose your salon over the many other options available.</p>

        <h3>13. Cancellation and Policy Information</h3>

        <p>Clear policies set expectations and reduce conflicts. Include your cancellation policy, deposit requirements, late arrival policy, and any other guidelines clients should know before booking.</p>

        <p>Present policies clearly but not harshly. The goal is to inform, not to intimidate potential clients.</p>

        <h3>14. New Client Information</h3>

        <p>First-time visitors often have questions specific to new clients. What should they expect at their first appointment? Is a consultation included? How early should they arrive? What information should they bring?</p>

        <p>Addressing these questions proactively makes new clients more comfortable booking and more likely to have a positive first experience.</p>

        <h3>15. Current, Accurate Information</h3>

        <p>Nothing on your website should be outdated. Team members who have left, services you no longer offer, old pricing, or incorrect hours damage trust. Clients assume if your website is neglected, your salon might be too.</p>

        <p>Establish a routine for reviewing and updating website content. Quarterly reviews at minimum, with immediate updates when significant changes occur.</p>

        <h2>Prioritizing Your Improvements</h2>

        <p>If your website is missing multiple elements, prioritize based on impact on bookings:</p>

        <p><strong>Critical priority:</strong> Online booking, services with prices, contact information, mobile responsiveness. These directly affect your ability to convert visitors into clients.</p>

        <p><strong>High priority:</strong> Portfolio gallery, stylist profiles, location details. These build the trust needed for visitors to commit to booking.</p>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> About page, policies, new client information, social links. These improve the overall experience and reduce friction.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Speed optimization, content updates, security. These require regular attention to maintain effectiveness.</p>

        <h2>Taking Action</h2>

        <p>Review your current salon website against this checklist. Note what is present, what needs improvement, and what is missing entirely. Create a prioritized plan to address gaps, starting with the elements that most directly impact booking conversions.</p>

        <p>A salon website that meets client expectations is not complicated. It simply requires attention to the details that matter to people deciding where to trust their hair.</p>
