Use high-quality photos of your completed projects to showcase your work.</li><li><strong>Engage in local link-building efforts:</strong> Collaborate with other Miami businesses by exchanging links or creating joint promotions. This not only boosts your SEO but also strengthens community ties.</li><li><strong>Utilize social media:</strong> Share images and stories of your projects on platforms like Instagram and Facebook.

Identify which keywords they rank for and consider how you can optimize your own content to compete effectively.</li></ul>
