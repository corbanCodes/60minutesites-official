This consistency helps Google trust your information.</li><li><strong>Complete Your Profile:</strong> Add your business hours, select relevant categories, and craft a compelling description that highlights what makes your business unique. For example, if you run a café, mention your specialty brews or locally sourced ingredients.</li><li><strong>Add Visual Appeal:</strong> Include high-quality images that showcase your products, services, or the ambiance of your business.
