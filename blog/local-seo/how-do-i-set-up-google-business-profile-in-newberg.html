If you’re running a popular spot like a winery or a family-friendly restaurant, ensure your information is always up-to-date to capture walk-in traffic.</li><li><strong>Gather reviews:</strong> Customer reviews on your profile boost your credibility and influence potential customers' decisions. Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews and respond to them to show you value their feedback.</li><li><strong>Post updates and offers:</strong> Regularly updating your profile with seasonal promotions, new menu items, or special events can keep your audience engaged.
