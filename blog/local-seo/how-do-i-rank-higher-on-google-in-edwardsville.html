Use these keywords naturally in your text, headings, and image alt tags to make your site more relevant to local searches.</li><li><strong>Encourage customers to leave reviews:</strong> Positive reviews on Google and Yelp can enhance your credibility. Consider asking satisfied customers to share their experiences, perhaps by offering a small discount on their next purchase as a thank you.</li><li><strong>Create local content:</strong> Write blog posts or articles that highlight local events or community stories.
