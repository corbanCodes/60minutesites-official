Don't forget to select the most relevant categories for your business to help Google understand what you do.</li><li><strong>Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews:</strong> Good reviews can significantly boost your credibility. Create a simple process for customers to leave feedback, perhaps by sending a follow-up email after a purchase. Respond to all reviews, positive or negative, to show that you value customer input.</li><li><strong>Use local keywords in your website content:</strong> Incorporate keywords that are specific to Bountiful, such as "best coffee in Bountiful" or "Bountiful home repairs." Use tools like Google Keyword Planner to discover phrases your potential customers are searching for.</li><li><strong>Ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are consistent:</strong> Discrepancies in your NAP across platforms can confuse search engines and customers alike.
