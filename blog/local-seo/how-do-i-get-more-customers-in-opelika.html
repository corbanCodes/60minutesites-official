For instance, if you own a craft store, you could host DIY craft nights. This not only drives traffic to your business but also creates a loyal customer base.</li><li><strong>Collaborate with neighboring businesses:</strong> Cross-promotion with nearby businesses can be mutually beneficial. For example, if you run a coffee shop, partner with a local bakery to offer a combined discount. This not only draws in customers from both establishments but also fosters community spirit.</li><li><strong>Utilize flyers and posters:</strong> Place flyers or posters in community centers, libraries, and local hangouts like the Opelika Sportsplex or the historic downtown area. Ensure that your promotional materials are eye-catching and convey your message clearly, highlighting any special promotions or events.</li><li><strong>Join the Opelika Chamber of Commerce:</strong> Becoming a member of the Chamber can open doors to networking opportunities, resources, and support.
