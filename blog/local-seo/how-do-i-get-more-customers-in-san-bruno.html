<h2>Online Strategies to Attract Customers</h2>

<p>In today's digital landscape, having a robust online presence is essential for small businesses in San Bruno.

Use 60 Minute Sites to easily build a site that highlights your products and services, offers clear contact information, and includes a blog for sharing news or insights related to your industry. Ensure that your website is mobile-responsive, as many customers will be browsing on their phones.</li><li><strong>Leverage social media platforms:</strong> Engage with your local community on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Share behind-the-scenes content, customer testimonials, and special promotions. Consider hosting live Q&A sessions or virtual tours of your business to build a more personal connection with your audience.</li><li><strong>Utilize Google My Business:</strong> Claim and optimize your Google My Business listing to improve your visibility in local search results. This tool allows you to provide essential information such as your address, business hours, and even photos of your offerings. Make sure to keep your information up-to-date, especially during holidays or special events.</li><li><strong>Run targeted ads on social media:</strong> Use Facebook and Instagram ads to reach potential customers based on their interests, location, and demographics. Create visually appealing ads that showcase your products or services with a clear call to action, like visiting your website or stopping by your store.</li><li><strong>Encourage customer reviews:</strong> Positive reviews on platforms like Yelp, Google, and Facebook can significantly influence potential customers. Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews by following up with them via email or offering a small incentive, like a discount on their next purchase. Respond to reviews, both positive and negative, to show that you value customer feedback and are committed to improving their experience.</li></ul>

Such collaborations can expand your customer base and enhance your visibility.</li><li><strong>Host workshops or classes:</strong> Consider hosting workshops or classes related to your business to draw in customers and foster community spirit. For instance, if you own a craft store, you might offer DIY classes that showcase your products.
