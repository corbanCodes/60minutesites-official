They suggest keywords, meta descriptions, and even analyze readability. For example, if you're a local real estate agent, the right tool can help you optimize content about housing trends in neighborhoods like Janesville’s historic district.</li><li><strong>Analyze Reader Engagement:</strong> AI can track how your audience interacts with your content, offering insights into which topics resonate the most.
