Focus on Tualatin and surrounding areas, using specific interests or demographics to refine your audience. For instance, promote family-friendly events if you own a children's store.</li><li><strong>Encourage Customer Reviews:</strong> Actively ask satisfied customers to leave reviews on platforms like Google and Yelp. Consider offering small incentives, such as discounts on their next purchase. Positive reviews not only enhance your reputation but also improve your search engine ranking.</li><li><strong>Start a Blog:</strong> Establish a blog on your website to share insights, tips, and news related to your business and the Tualatin area.
