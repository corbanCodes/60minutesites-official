This is especially important for businesses in Romulus that may have fluctuating hours or seasonal operations.</li><li><strong>Helps you manage customer reviews and respond promptly:</strong> Reviews are crucial for local businesses.

<h2>How to Set Up Your Google Business Profile</h2>

<p>Creating your Google Business Profile is straightforward.
