Share behind-the-scenes content, customer testimonials, and updates about local events. For instance, if you’re a local restaurant, post mouth-watering photos of your dishes while promoting any special events or menu items that align with local celebrations.</li><li><strong>Create Valuable Content:</strong> Develop blog posts and videos that resonate with local interests. Consider writing about the history of West Linn or featuring local artists and their work.

This not only broadens your audience but also fosters a sense of community.</li><li><strong>Offer Exclusive In-Store Promotions:</strong> Create enticing in-store promotions or discounts to attract walk-in customers. Think of seasonal offers or loyalty programs that reward repeat customers. For instance, offer a ‘buy one, get one free’ deal during the holiday season to draw in more traffic.</li><li><strong>Network with Local Organizations:</strong> Get involved with the West Linn Chamber of Commerce and participate in their meetings and events. This can open doors to valuable referrals and connections that can help grow your business.</li><li><strong>Host Workshops or Community Events:</strong> Establish yourself as a local expert by hosting workshops or events that engage the community.
