Responding to reviews—both positive and negative—demonstrates to potential clients that you value feedback.</li><li><strong>Provides Essential Information:</strong> Your profile allows you to share crucial details like hours of operation, contact information, and even directions to your location, making it easier for customers to reach you. Think of it as a digital storefront that’s always open.</li><li><strong>Offers Insights:</strong> Google provides analytics on how customers find your business, whether through search terms, direct visits, or referrals.
