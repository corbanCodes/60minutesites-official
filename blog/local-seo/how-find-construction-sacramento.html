You can also check out Nextdoor for hyper-local advice.</li><li><strong>Checking local bulletin boards:</strong> Cafes or community centers often have flyers or business cards posted by local tradespeople. Places such as The Coffee Garden or the Sacramento Public Library can be excellent resources.</li></ul>

<h2>Attend Local Home Shows and Expos</h2>

<p>Home shows are fantastic opportunities to meet construction professionals face-to-face. Consider these points:</p><ul><li><strong>Check local listings for upcoming home shows:</strong> Events like the Sacramento Home & Garden Show, held at the Cal Expo, are great places to meet multiple contractors under one roof.</li><li><strong>Network with contractors:</strong> Engage with them directly about their previous projects.
