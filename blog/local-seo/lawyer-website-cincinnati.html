<h2>Key Features of an Effective Lawyer Website</h2>

<p>When designing your lawyer website, consider incorporating these features to ensure it meets the needs of your potential clients:</p><ul><li><strong>Clear navigation:</strong> Simplify the user experience by categorizing services and providing a straightforward menu. Make sure that key pages like ‘About Us’, ‘Services’, and ‘Contact’ are easily accessible.</li><li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> Ensure your site looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
