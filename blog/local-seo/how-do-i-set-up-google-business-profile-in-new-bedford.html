Ensure it matches the name you use in the real world, as consistency is key for searchability and brand recognition.</li><li><strong>Select Your Category:</strong> Choose the most appropriate category for your business.

Pictures of mouth-watering dishes or well-curated merchandise can capture attention and draw customers in.</li><li><strong>Verify Your Business:</strong> Complete the verification process to confirm your business's legitimacy.
