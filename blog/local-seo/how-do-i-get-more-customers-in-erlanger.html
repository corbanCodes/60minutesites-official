Share behind-the-scenes content, special promotions, and upcoming events. For instance, if you run a boutique, post regular updates of new arrivals and style tips to connect with your audience.</li><li><strong>Encourage online reviews:</strong> Leverage platforms like Google and Yelp by prompting satisfied customers to leave positive reviews. Provide incentives such as discounts on their next purchase for doing so. Positive reviews not only enhance your credibility but also attract new customers.</li><li><strong>Start an email newsletter:</strong> Regularly communicate with your customers by sending out a newsletter that includes exclusive offers, updates on new products, or information about community involvement. This keeps your business top-of-mind and encourages repeat visits.</li><li><strong>Invest in local SEO:</strong> Optimize your website for local search by including keywords that relate to Erlanger and your specific offerings.

For instance, a coffee shop could partner with a bookstore for a “Books and Brews” event, attracting customers from both businesses.</li><li><strong>Offer exclusive in-store promotions:</strong> Create enticing deals or loyalty programs that encourage repeat visits. For example, offer a punch card system where customers receive a free item after a certain number of purchases.</li><li><strong>Host workshops or classes:</strong> Conduct workshops that engage the community and showcase your expertise, whether it's a cooking class at a grocery store or a craft night at a local art shop.
