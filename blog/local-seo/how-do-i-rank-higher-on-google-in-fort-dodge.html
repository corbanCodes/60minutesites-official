Use high-quality images that showcase your products or services and create posts to keep your audience engaged.</li><li><strong>Encourage Positive Reviews:</strong> Customer reviews play a crucial role in local search rankings. Prompt satisfied customers to leave positive reviews on Google and other review platforms like Yelp and TripAdvisor. Consider implementing a follow-up email campaign after purchases to gently ask for feedback and reviews.</li><li><strong>Use Local Keywords:</strong> Incorporate local keywords in your website content to increase relevancy. Think about what your customers might search for, such as 'Fort Dodge bakery' or 'best Fort Dodge plumbing services.' Use these keywords in your page titles, meta descriptions, and throughout your content.</li><li><strong>Mobile-Friendly Website:</strong> Many local searches are conducted via smartphones, so it’s essential to have a mobile-friendly website.
