Here are some foundational tips to get you started:</p><ul><li><strong>Claim and optimize your Google My Business listing:</strong> Ensure that your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are accurate. Add high-quality images, your business hours, and a compelling description that includes local keywords.</li><li><strong>Use local keywords:</strong> Incorporate specific terms like "Parkland pizza" or "Parkland landscaping" throughout your website's content, including titles, meta descriptions, and headers. This helps Google understand your relevance to local searches.</li><li><strong>Encourage happy customers to leave positive reviews:</strong> Engage your satisfied customers by asking them to review your business on platforms like Google and Yelp. Positive reviews improve your credibility and help boost your rankings.</li><li><strong>Ensure consistency across all platforms:</strong> Your NAP should be the same everywhere online, whether it's on social media, your website, or local directories. Inconsistencies can confuse search engines and hurt your rankings.</li><li><strong>Create local content:</strong> Write blog posts about local events, attractions, or community stories that resonate with Parkland residents.
