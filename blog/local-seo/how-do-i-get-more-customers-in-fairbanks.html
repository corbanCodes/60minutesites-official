For example, if you run a café, include your menu, location, and a cozy photo of your space to entice visitors.</li><li><strong>Utilize social media platforms:</strong> Leverage platforms like Facebook and Instagram to engage with potential customers. Share captivating photos of your products, behind-the-scenes stories, and participate in local events. For instance, if you’re hosting a seasonal event, create an engaging event page and share it within local community groups.</li><li><strong>Invest in search engine optimization (SEO):</strong> Optimize your website for local search terms such as “best coffee in Fairbanks” or “Fairbanks family-friendly activities.” This helps improve your visibility on search engines, making it easier for customers to find you. Utilize tools like Google My Business to manage your online presence.</li><li><strong>Encourage online reviews:</strong> Positive feedback on platforms like Google My Business and Yelp is crucial, especially in a close-knit community like Fairbanks where word-of-mouth matters. Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews by following up with them post-purchase and offering incentives, such as a discount on their next visit.</li><li><strong>Consider running targeted online ads:</strong> Use Facebook Ads or Google Ads to reach specific demographics in Fairbanks.

If you own a craft store, consider hosting a crafting night. This not only promotes your business but also fosters community engagement.</li><li><strong>Use local newspapers and community bulletin boards:</strong> Advertise special promotions or events in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner or on community boards at places like the Fairbanks Public Library.
