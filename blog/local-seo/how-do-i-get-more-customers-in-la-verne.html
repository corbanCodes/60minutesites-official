After a purchase or service, kindly ask satisfied customers to leave a review on Google and Yelp. You can even incentivize reviews by offering small discounts for future visits.</li><li><strong>Implement local SEO practices:</strong> Optimize your website for local search results by including keywords related to La Verne in your content, such as 'best coffee in La Verne' or 'La Verne bakery.'
