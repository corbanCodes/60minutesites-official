This way, you’re always in touch with what your audience is searching for.</li><li><strong>Drafting Articles:</strong> Once you have your topic, AI can create initial drafts based on outlines you provide.

This means you can set your blog to publish at optimal times without needing daily attention. For instance, you can schedule posts to go live during the weekend when more locals are browsing for things to do.</li><li><strong>Performance Analytics:</strong> After your content goes live, AI can analyze engagement metrics to see which topics resonate with your audience. This insight helps you tailor future content to better meet the interests of your Walnut community, ensuring you’re always relevant.</li></ul>
