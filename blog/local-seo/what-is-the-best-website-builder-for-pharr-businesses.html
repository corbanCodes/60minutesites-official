This means that even outside of business hours, you can still attract customers who are browsing online.</li><li><strong>Marketing Tool:</strong> It serves as a platform for digital marketing strategies, such as SEO (search engine optimization) and social media integration, to attract more customers. For instance, sharing your website link on social media platforms can help drive traffic directly to your site.</li><li><strong>Showcase Products/Services:</strong> You can highlight your offerings, share testimonials, and provide essential information all in one place. Utilize high-quality images and engaging descriptions to entice visitors. Think about adding a blog or a news section where you can keep your audience updated on special promotions or new menu items.</li></ul>
