This means that locals can easily access the information they need, which can lead to increased footfall and phone inquiries.</li><li><strong>Enables customer reviews:</strong> Positive reviews on your profile enhance your reputation and can significantly influence purchasing decisions. In a community-focused town like Dickinson, word-of-mouth is powerful, and online reviews can bolster your credibility.</li><li><strong>Offers insights:</strong> Google provides analytics that show how customers find and interact with your listing. Understanding these metrics can help you refine your marketing strategies to better engage with your audience.</li><li><strong>Allows you to post updates:</strong> You can share news, offers, and events directly through your profile.
