Ensure it is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and mobile-friendly. Include essential information such as your location, hours of operation, and contact details. Use high-quality images of your products or services to grab attention.</li><li><strong>Engage with local customers on social media:</strong> Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are excellent for sharing your story.
