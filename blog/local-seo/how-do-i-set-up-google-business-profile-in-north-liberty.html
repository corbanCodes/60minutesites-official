If you have social media profiles, consider linking those as well to enhance your online presence.</li><li><strong>Upload quality images:</strong> Pictures speak a thousand words. Use high-quality images of your business exterior, interior, and products. For instance, if you run a local restaurant, showcase your best dishes to entice potential customers.</li><li><strong>Verify your business:</strong> Google usually offers verification via mail or phone. Follow the instructions provided carefully to complete this crucial step, as it confirms your business's legitimacy and helps prevent fraudulent listings.</li></ul>
