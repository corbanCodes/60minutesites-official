Share behind-the-scenes content, showcase daily specials, and highlight community events you’re participating in. Consider creating a dedicated hashtag for your business and encourage customers to use it when they share their experiences.</li><li><strong>Encourage customer reviews:</strong> Actively ask satisfied customers to leave reviews on Google and Yelp. You could even create a small incentive, like a discount on their next purchase, to encourage feedback. Positive reviews build credibility and can significantly influence new customers’ decisions.</li><li><strong>Implement local SEO practices:</strong> Optimize your website for local search by including keywords relevant to Sebastian. Use phrases like “best coffee in Sebastian” or “Sebastian’s top-rated boutique.” Register your business on Google My Business to ensure it appears in local searches, and keep your information updated.</li><li><strong>Consider running online ads:</strong> Use targeted online ads on platforms like Facebook and Google to reach specific demographics in Sebastian.
