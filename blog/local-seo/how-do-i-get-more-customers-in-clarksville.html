 <h2>Social Media Engagement</h2>

<p>Social media isn't just for big brands. Small businesses in Clarksville can thrive here too:</p><ul><li>Choose platforms where your target audience hangs out; Facebook and Instagram are great places to start.</li><li>Post regularly about your services, community involvement, or behind-the-scenes looks at your business.</li><li>Use local hashtags to connect with nearby customers.</li><li>Run contests or promotions to increase engagement and reach.</li></ul>
