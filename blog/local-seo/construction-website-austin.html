<h2>Austin-Specific Design Elements</h2>

<p>To connect with the local community, infuse your website with elements that resonate with Austinites:</p><ul><li><strong>Incorporate local landmarks or themes in your design.</strong> Consider using the iconic architecture of the Texas State Capitol or the vibrant colors of the South Congress neighborhood as inspiration for your site’s aesthetic.
