This is your gateway to creating a profile that stands out.</li><li><strong>Click on ‘Manage now’:</strong> Sign in with your existing Google account, or take a moment to create a new one if you don’t have one yet. Having a dedicated account for your business can streamline managing your online presence.</li><li><strong>Enter your business name and address:</strong> Make sure the name matches exactly how it appears in the real world. Local searchers in Bryan need to find you easily, so accuracy is key. If you’re in a specific area, like the bustling downtown, mention it to increase visibility.</li><li><strong>Select the appropriate category:</strong> Choose a category that best fits your business.

This helps Google show your business to the right audience.</li><li><strong>Add your business phone number and website:</strong> If you have a website, include it to give potential customers more information about your services. Your phone number is also crucial for local inquiries, so make sure it’s correct.</li><li><strong>Verify your business:</strong> Google will require you to verify your business to ensure legitimacy. This could be through a postcard sent to your address, a phone call, or email verification. This step is essential for building trust with your customers.</li><li><strong>Enhance your profile:</strong> After verification, it’s time to make your profile shine. Upload high-quality photos of your business, whether it’s the inviting interior of your store or your delicious menu items.
