<p>Building relationships with local businesses and organizations can significantly boost your gym's authority. Here are some effective tactics:</p><ul><li><strong>Partner with local health-related businesses:</strong> Collaborate with nearby health food stores, physiotherapists, or wellness centers for joint promotions or events.
