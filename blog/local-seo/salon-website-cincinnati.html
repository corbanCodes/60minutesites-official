High-quality images of your work, such as haircuts, colors, and styling, can make a significant impact.</li><li><strong>Easy navigation:</strong> Your website should be intuitive, allowing potential clients to find what they need quickly. Consider categorizing services, offering a clear menu, and including a search feature.</li><li><strong>Mobile optimization:</strong> With a considerable number of users browsing on mobile devices, ensure your website is responsive, meaning it will look great on any screen size.
