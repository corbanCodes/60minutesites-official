Make sure to include your office hours, location, and services offered. Engaging with client inquiries and posting updates can further boost your profile.</li><li><strong>Client Reviews:</strong> Encourage satisfied clients to leave positive reviews on Google and Yelp, which not only builds trust but also boosts your local SEO. Consider setting up a follow-up email after a case concludes, politely asking for feedback and reviews.</li></ul>
