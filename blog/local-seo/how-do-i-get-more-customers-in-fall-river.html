For instance, if you run a bakery, team up with a local coffee shop for a discount on a pastry and coffee combo, encouraging customers from both businesses to visit each other.</li><li><strong>Offer special promotions:</strong> Attract first-time customers by providing exclusive deals or discounts. Consider a 'Buy One, Get One Free' offer or a percentage off their first purchase to encourage foot traffic into your store.</li><li><strong>Network with local organizations:</strong> Engaging with local chambers of commerce or business associations can open doors to collaboration and networking opportunities. Attend meetings and events to connect with other business owners who might refer customers to you.</li><li><strong>Host workshops or community events:</strong> Establish your business as a knowledge hub by offering workshops relevant to your expertise.
