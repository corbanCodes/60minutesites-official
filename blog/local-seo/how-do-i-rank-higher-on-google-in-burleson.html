Add high-quality images that represent your business well.</li><li><strong>Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number):</strong> Make sure your business name, address, and phone number are consistent across all online platforms, including your website, social media, and local directories. This consistency helps Google verify your business's legitimacy.</li><li><strong>Encourage customer reviews:</strong> Satisfied customers can have a huge impact on your ranking. Ask them to leave positive reviews on Google and other review platforms. Consider offering a small incentive for leaving a review, such as a discount on their next purchase.</li><li><strong>Incorporate local keywords:</strong> Use local keywords in your website content, meta descriptions, and blog posts.
