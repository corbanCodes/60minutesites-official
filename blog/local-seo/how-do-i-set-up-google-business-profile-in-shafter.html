This transparency builds trust with potential customers and ensures they have all the information they need to choose you.</li><li><strong>Enhances your reputation:</strong> Responding to reviews—both positive and negative—shows that you value customer feedback. Engaging with your audience can significantly boost your reputation and encourage more individuals to choose your business.</li><li><strong>Offers insights into customer behavior:</strong> Google Business Profile provides analytics that show how customers interact with your profile.
