This not only boosts your SEO but also engages the community.</li><li><strong>Encourage customer reviews:</strong> Happy customers are your best advocates. Ask them to leave reviews on Google and Yelp, and make it a point to respond to all reviews, both positive and negative. This engagement shows you value customer feedback and helps build trust with potential clients.</li></ul>
