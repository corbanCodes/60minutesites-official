Include well-known local landmarks in your descriptions as well.</li><li>Encourage customers to leave positive reviews on Google and Yelp, perhaps by offering a small discount or incentive for their time.</li><li>Ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are consistent across all platforms, including local directories like St. Louis Magazine and the St. Louis Business Journal.</li><li>Create location-specific content that resonates with St. Louis culture, such as blog posts about local festivals like the St. Louis Art Fair or the Great Forest Park Balloon Race.</li></ul>
