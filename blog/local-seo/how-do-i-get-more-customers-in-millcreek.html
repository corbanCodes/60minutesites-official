Consider adding a blog section to share insights related to your industry, which can help establish your authority.</li><li><strong>Utilize social media platforms:</strong> Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are powerful tools for engagement. Regularly post high-quality photos of your products, behind-the-scenes glimpses of your business, and customer testimonials.

Optimize your Google My Business profile with accurate information, encourage reviews, and use relevant keywords in your website content. This will improve your visibility when locals search for products or services you offer.</li><li><strong>Encourage customer reviews:</strong> Online reviews can make or break a small business. Actively ask satisfied customers to leave reviews on platforms like Google and Yelp. You can do this by sending follow-up emails after a purchase or by providing incentives such as discounts for future visits.</li><li><strong>Create targeted online ads:</strong> Utilize platforms like Facebook Ads to run targeted campaigns aimed at specific demographics within Millcreek.
