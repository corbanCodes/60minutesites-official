Test your site on various devices to ensure a seamless experience for all users.</li><li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> Use high-quality images that showcase your gym, classes, and community. Consider hiring a local photographer to capture the essence of your space and the energy of your classes, which can make a significant difference in attracting new members.</li><li><strong>Class Schedules:</strong> Make it easy for potential members to view and sign up for classes by integrating a user-friendly calendar.
