<h2>Why Set Up a Google Business Profile?</h2>

<p>Your Google Business Profile is crucial for your visibility in Bixby. By ensuring your business is listed, you not only help customers find you easily, but you also provide them with important information, like your hours and contact details. Here’s what you can expect when you set up your profile:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased online visibility:</strong> Your business will appear in local searches and on Google Maps, making it easier for potential customers to discover you. Think of it as your digital storefront that’s open 24/7.</li><li><strong>Ability to engage with customer reviews:</strong> Responding to reviews shows customers that you value their feedback. It’s a great way to build relationships and encourage more people to choose your business over competitors.</li><li><strong>Insights on customer interactions:</strong> Google provides data on how customers find and interact with your listing—information like how they found you (via search or maps) and what actions they took (like visiting your website or calling you). This can help you tailor your marketing strategies.</li><li><strong>Free advertising for your products and services:</strong> You can post updates, offers, and new products directly on your profile, essentially giving you a free platform to promote what you offer.

Make it as easy as possible for customers to reach you. If you have special hours for holidays, be sure to note those as well.</li><li><strong>Verify your business:</strong> You can verify your business via mail or phone. This step is crucial as it confirms your authenticity to Google and helps build trust with potential customers.</li></ul>
