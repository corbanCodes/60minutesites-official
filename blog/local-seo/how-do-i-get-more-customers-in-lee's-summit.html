This includes using relevant keywords related to your products and services, creating location-specific content, and claiming your Google My Business listing. Encourage customers to leave reviews on your listing, as positive feedback can significantly influence new customers.</li><li><strong>Encourage online reviews:</strong> Positive reviews can dramatically enhance your business’s reputation. After a purchase, send a follow-up email thanking customers and kindly ask them to leave a review on platforms like Yelp or Google. You can also offer incentives, such as discounts on future purchases, to motivate customers to share their experiences.</li><li><strong>Run targeted online ads:</strong> Consider using Facebook and Google Ads to run targeted campaigns aimed at reaching potential customers within Lee's Summit and surrounding neighborhoods.

Send postcards or flyers introducing your business and any special promotions to local neighborhoods. Be sure to include a compelling call-to-action, such as a limited-time discount, to encourage immediate responses.</li><li><strong>Place eye-catching signage:</strong> Invest in attractive, professional signage outside your storefront to draw the attention of pedestrians and passing vehicles.
