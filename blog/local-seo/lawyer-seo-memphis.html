Follow up with clients after a case closure and kindly request them to leave feedback on Google and other review platforms.</li><li><strong>Use location-based keywords:</strong> Infuse your website content with specific geographic keywords, like 'Memphis estate planning lawyer' or 'bankruptcy attorney in Downtown Memphis', to help you rank better in local searches.</li><li><strong>Engage with local directories:</strong> List your practice in local online directories such as Yelp, Avvo, and the Memphis Bar Association.

These case studies not only showcase your skills but also build trust with potential clients.</li></ul>
