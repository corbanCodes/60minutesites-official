Here’s why you should set one up:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhances visibility:</strong> Your business will show up when locals search for services you offer, such as ‘best tacos in Sweetwater’ or ‘hardware store near me.’ This is crucial when residents are scrolling through their options.</li><li><strong>Builds credibility:</strong> A well-maintained profile reinforces trust with potential customers. When your business has up-to-date information, high ratings, and positive reviews, it instills confidence in those considering your services.</li><li><strong>Offers insights:</strong> You can see how customers interact with your profile, from searches to calls.
