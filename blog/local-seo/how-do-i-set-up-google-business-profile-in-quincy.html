This helps Google connect you with potential customers searching for specific offerings.</li><li><strong>Add your phone number and website URL:</strong> Ensure your contact information is correct, as this is how customers will reach you.</li><li><strong>Verify your business:</strong> Google will require you to verify your business via phone, email, or by receiving a postcard.
