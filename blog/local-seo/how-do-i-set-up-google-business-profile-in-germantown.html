Be sure to verify your business, which may involve receiving a postcard at your business address from Google to confirm your location.</li><li><strong>Fill Out Your Information:</strong> Enter your business name, address, phone number, category, and website. Make sure everything is accurate and matches your other online listings.

Include photos of your storefront, products, and any team members. For example, if you’re a restaurant, consider adding mouthwatering images of your signature dishes or the inviting atmosphere of your dining area.</li><li><strong>Write a Compelling Description:</strong> Describe what makes your business unique. Include keywords that locals might use when searching. For instance, emphasize your specialty coffee blends and warm ambiance if you run a café.</li><li><strong>Set Your Hours:</strong> Clearly state your working hours, including any special hours for holidays. If you're a local service provider, consider noting peak hours for service calls.</li><li><strong>Encourage Reviews:</strong> Ask your customers to leave reviews.
