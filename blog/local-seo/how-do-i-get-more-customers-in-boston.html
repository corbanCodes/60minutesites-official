 <h2>Leveraging Social Media</h2>

<p>Social media can amplify your visibility and connect you with customers. Here’s what I’ve seen work:</p><ul><li>Choose the right platforms—focus on where your audience hangs out (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), leveraging Boston's vibrant online community.</li><li>Post regularly with engaging content—think behind-the-scenes, tips, and customer stories that resonate with Boston's culture and lifestyle.</li><li>Use local hashtags to reach Boston residents, such as #BostonBusiness or #ShopLocalBoston.</li><li>Run targeted ads to attract local customers, especially for special promotions during Boston's peak tourism seasons.</li><li>Engage with followers by responding to comments and messages promptly, fostering a sense of community.</li></ul>
