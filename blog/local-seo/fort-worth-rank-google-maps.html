 <h2>Understanding Google Maps Ranking Factors</h2>

 <p>To effectively rank on Google Maps, it's critical to understand the key factors that influence your position. Google uses a variety of criteria to determine how businesses are ranked, including:</p>

2. **Distance**: How far your business is from the location of the searcher. Proximity plays a significant role in local searches.
3. **Prominence**: This is based on how well-known your business is. Prominence is determined by factors like the number of reviews, the quality of those reviews, and your business's overall online presence.</p>

 <p>Understanding these factors will help you tailor your strategies to improve your visibility on Google Maps.</p>

 <h2>Create and Optimize Your Google Business Profile</h2>

 <p>Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is your first step in ranking on Google Maps. Follow these steps to optimize it:</p>
