Share updates, special promotions, and captivating visuals of your products or services. Consider running contests or giveaways to increase engagement and draw in new customers. For instance, a photo contest featuring your coffee shop's best latte art can encourage patrons to share their experiences online.</li><li><strong>Leverage Google My Business:</strong> Claim your business on Google My Business to improve your visibility in local searches. Ensure that your business information is accurate, including hours of operation, address, and contact information.
