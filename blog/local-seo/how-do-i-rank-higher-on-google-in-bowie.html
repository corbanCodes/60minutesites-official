Regularly updating your profile keeps your audience engaged and shows Google that your business is active, which can improve ranking.</li></ul>

<h2>Leverage Local Keywords</h2>

<p>Choosing the right keywords is fundamental for improving your visibility in local searches. Focus on:</p><ul><li><strong>Local Phrases:</strong> Incorporate phrases like 'Bowie' and 'Prince George’s County' throughout your website content, including headers and image alt texts. This helps Google associate your business with local searches.</li><li><strong>Long-Tail Keywords:</strong> Think about what potential customers are likely to search for.
