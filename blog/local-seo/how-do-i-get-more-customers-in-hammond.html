For instance, a nearby bakery and coffee shop could offer a discount for customers who visit both locations. This collaboration not only attracts customers but also strengthens local ties.</li><li><strong>Utilize flyers and posters:</strong> Place eye-catching flyers in strategic locations like coffee shops, libraries, and community centers, where residents often gather.
