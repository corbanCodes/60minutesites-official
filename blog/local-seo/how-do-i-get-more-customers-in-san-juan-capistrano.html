For example, if you own a bakery, collaborate with a local coffee shop to offer a special discount on a coffee and pastry combo, creating a win-win for both businesses.</li><li><strong>Utilize flyers and posters:</strong> Design eye-catching flyers that highlight your services and distribute them in community centers, libraries, and local cafes. Make sure to include a special offer or event to entice people to visit your business.</li><li><strong>Join local business organizations:</strong> Becoming a member of the San Juan Capistrano Chamber of Commerce can open doors to networking and collaboration opportunities.
