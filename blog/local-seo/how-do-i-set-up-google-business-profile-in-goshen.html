Responding to reviews shows that you value feedback, which can encourage more people to choose your business.</li><li><strong>Accurate information about your location, hours, and services:</strong> Your profile ensures that customers have access to up-to-date information. If you're located near popular landmarks like the Goshen Theater or the historic downtown area, make sure to highlight that to attract foot traffic.</li><li><strong>Insights into customer behavior:</strong> Google provides valuable insights into how customers find and interact with your business.
