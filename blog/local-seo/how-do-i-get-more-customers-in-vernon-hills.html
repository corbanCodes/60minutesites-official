Tailor your ads to reflect local interests, such as promoting a special on a holiday celebrated in the area, like the Vernon Hills Independence Day Parade.</li><li><strong>Encourage customer reviews:</strong> Positive feedback can significantly sway potential customers. Promptly respond to reviews on Google and Yelp, thanking reviewers for their feedback and addressing any concerns. Consider offering incentives for customers to leave reviews, such as discounts on their next purchase.</li><li><strong>Start an email newsletter:</strong> Keep your customers informed about promotions, events, and new offerings.
