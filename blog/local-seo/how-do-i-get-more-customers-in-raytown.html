Offering discounts for referrals can also motivate local businesses to send customers your way.</li><li><strong>Establish a loyalty program:</strong> Create a loyalty program that rewards repeat customers with discounts or special offers. This not only encourages repeat business but also turns your customers into advocates for your brand, as they will share their positive experiences with friends and family.</li><li><strong>Host workshops or classes:</strong> Tap into the community’s interests by hosting workshops that relate to your business.
