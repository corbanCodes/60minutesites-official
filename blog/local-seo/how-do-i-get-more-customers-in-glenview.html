Include high-quality images of your products or services, clear calls to action, and an easy way for customers to contact you. For example, if you run a bakery, showcase mouthwatering photos of your pastries along with an online ordering system to streamline purchases.</li><li><strong>Utilize social media platforms:</strong> Engage with your audience on popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and even TikTok. Share behind-the-scenes content, customer testimonials, and promotions. For instance, a local coffee shop could post daily specials or offer sneak peeks of new menu items, encouraging customers to visit.</li><li><strong>Implement local SEO techniques:</strong> Optimize your website and online listings for local searches. Use keywords specific to Glenview, such as “best pizza in Glenview” or “Glenview boutique,” to help potential customers find your business. Registering with Google My Business can also enhance your visibility in local search results.</li><li><strong>Encourage online reviews:</strong> Ask satisfied customers to leave positive reviews on platforms like Yelp, Google, and Facebook. Highlighting these testimonials on your website can strengthen your credibility. Consider offering a small discount on their next purchase as an incentive for leaving a review.</li><li><strong>Offer online promotions:</strong> Attract new customers with exclusive online discounts or special deals.

Setting up a booth allows you to showcase your products and interact directly with potential customers. Consider hosting a tasting or demonstration to draw in a crowd.</li><li><strong>Network with other local businesses:</strong> Form partnerships with nearby businesses for cross-promotions. For instance, a local florist could collaborate with a wedding planner to offer joint packages, reaching a broader audience while supporting one another.</li><li><strong>Distribute promotional materials:</strong> Create eye-catching flyers or postcards and distribute them in high-traffic areas like the Glenview Park Center, local coffee shops, or community bulletin boards. Be sure to include a special promotion to entice people to visit your store.</li><li><strong>Host workshops or classes:</strong> Engage the community by offering free or low-cost workshops related to your business.
