For instance, if you own a bakery, select 'Bakery' to ensure you connect with the right audience.</li><li><strong>Add Your Location:</strong> If you have a physical address, include it so customers can easily find you. This is particularly important for businesses located near popular landmarks like the St. Cloud Riverwalk.</li><li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Offer a phone number and website link.
