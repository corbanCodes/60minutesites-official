Include engaging content about your products or services, high-quality images, and a clear call to action. Make sure it’s optimized for mobile users, as many customers will be browsing from their smartphones.</li><li><strong>Utilize social media:</strong> Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are perfect for showcasing your offerings. Post engaging content regularly, such as behind-the-scenes looks, customer testimonials, or special promotions. Use local hashtags, like #CarrboroEats or #ShopCarrboro, to connect with your community.</li><li><strong>Invest in local SEO:</strong> Optimize your website for local searches by including keywords relevant to your business and location. Create a Google My Business listing and ensure your information is accurate. This helps your business appear in search results when people look for services in Carrboro.</li><li><strong>Encourage customer reviews:</strong> Happy customers can significantly boost your visibility. Prompt satisfied clients to leave reviews on platforms like Google and Yelp.
