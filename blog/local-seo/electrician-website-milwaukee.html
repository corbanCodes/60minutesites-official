This not only showcases your expertise but also your problem-solving abilities.</li><li><strong>Video testimonials:</strong> Ask satisfied clients to share their experiences in short video clips. These personal stories can resonate more with potential customers than written testimonials alone.</li><li><strong>Highlight your work in key Milwaukee neighborhoods:</strong> Create specific project spotlights in neighborhoods known for their unique electrical needs or historical homes, such as the Historic Third Ward or Riverwest. This personal touch can help potential customers relate to your work.</li></ul>
