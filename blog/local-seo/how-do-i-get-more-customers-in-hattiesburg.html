Use local imagery and testimonials to create a sense of familiarity. Ensure that it’s mobile-friendly, as many customers will search for local businesses on their phones.</li><li><strong>Utilize social media:</strong> Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are powerful tools for connecting with the local community. Share stories about your business, highlight local partnerships, and engage with your audience through regular posts and updates. Consider running local-targeted ads to reach potential customers in Hattiesburg.</li><li><strong>Implement search engine optimization (SEO):</strong> Work on local SEO by including Hattiesburg-related keywords in your website content. This might include phrases like “best coffee in Hattiesburg” or “Hattiesburg boutique.” Register your business with Google My Business to help it appear in local searches.</li><li><strong>Engage with online reviews:</strong> Online reviews can significantly influence customer decisions. Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive feedback on platforms like Yelp and Google. Respond to reviews—both positive and negative—showing that you value customer opinions and are committed to improving their experience.</li><li><strong>Consider email marketing:</strong> Build an email list by offering a discount or freebie in exchange for email sign-ups. Use this list to inform your customers about promotions, new product launches, or special events. Make your emails visually appealing and personalized to increase engagement.</li></ul>

For instance, a local bakery could team up with a coffee shop to offer a special deal. This not only increases your reach but also fosters a sense of community.</li><li><strong>Host workshops or informational sessions:</strong> Share your expertise by hosting free workshops or seminars. If you own a craft store, consider hosting a DIY project night. This not only brings foot traffic into your store but also positions you as a knowledgeable leader in your field.</li><li><strong>Offer special discounts for first-time customers:</strong> Create enticing offers for newcomers to encourage them to visit your business. For example, offer a “first visit” discount or a free gift with their first purchase to make a lasting impression.</li><li><strong>Join the Hattiesburg Chamber of Commerce:</strong> Becoming a member can provide invaluable networking opportunities.
