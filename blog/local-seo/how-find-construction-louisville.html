Subscribing to their newsletters can keep you in the loop about significant projects.</li><li><strong>Community boards:</strong> Check bulletin boards at local community centers and libraries for announcements on construction and renovations. These boards often include flyers and information about upcoming projects that may not be covered in the news.</li></ul>
