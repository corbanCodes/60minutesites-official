Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews on Google My Business and Yelp, and consider offering small incentives, like discounts on their next purchase, for leaving feedback.</li><li><strong>Invest in local SEO</strong>: Optimize your website with keywords specific to Collierville, such as “best coffee in Collierville” or “Collierville boutique.” Ensure your business is listed in local directories and that your contact information is consistent across all platforms.</li><li><strong>Run targeted online ads</strong>: Use platforms like Facebook Ads to create targeted campaigns that focus on the Collierville area.
