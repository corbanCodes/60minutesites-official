Attend their meetings, workshops, and social events to meet other professionals and learn about upcoming projects directly from industry insiders.</li><li><strong>City Public Notices</strong>: Keep an eye on public notices published in local newspapers or online city portals. These notices often list upcoming projects, public hearings, and developer proposals that may not yet be widely known.</li><li><strong>Neighborhood Newsletters</strong>: Many neighborhoods, such as the Richmond or Sunset, have newsletters that highlight community construction efforts and developments.
