Invite happy customers to leave reviews on Google and other platforms. Consider following up with an email thanking them for their business and kindly asking for their feedback.</li><li><strong>Optimize Your Website with Local Keywords:</strong> Incorporate local keywords seamlessly into your website’s content. Use terms like 'Edmonds coffee shop,' 'Edmonds real estate,' or even reference nearby landmarks like the Edmonds Underwater Park to improve relevance in local searches.</li><li><strong>Engage in Local Events and Sponsorships:</strong> Participate in community events or sponsor local sports teams. This increases your visibility and can lead to valuable backlinks to your website from local news outlets and community blogs.</li><li><strong>Utilize Social Media:</strong> Connect with the Edmonds community through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
