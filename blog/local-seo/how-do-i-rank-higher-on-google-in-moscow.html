After a purchase, kindly ask customers to leave a review, perhaps by sending a follow-up email with a direct link.</li><li><strong>Add quality images:</strong> Showcase your business with high-resolution photos that reflect your brand. Include pictures of your products, your storefront, and happy customers to create a welcoming atmosphere.</li></ul>
