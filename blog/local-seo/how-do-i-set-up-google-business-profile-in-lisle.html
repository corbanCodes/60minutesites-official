This free tool significantly enhances your visibility on both Google Search and Maps, ensuring that locals and visitors alike can find you easily. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting it up:</p><ul><li><strong>Visit the Google Business Profile website:</strong> Start by navigating to the Google Business Profile website and clicking on 'Manage now' to create your profile.</li><li><strong>Sign in or create an account:</strong> Use your existing Google account to sign in, or if you don’t have one, take a moment to create a new account; it’s quick and easy.</li><li><strong>Enter your business name and address:</strong> Accuracy is key here. Make sure to enter your business name exactly as it appears in the real world, along with your complete address, as this will help Google serve your business to the right audience.</li><li><strong>Select the correct business category:</strong> Choosing the right category helps Google understand your offerings. For instance, if you run a bakery, select 'Bakery' so customers searching for sweet treats can find you effortlessly.</li><li><strong>Provide essential business information:</strong> Go beyond just the basics. Include your phone number, website link, and hours of operation. Consider adding attributes like 'Wheelchair accessible' or 'Outdoor seating' to appeal to specific customer preferences.</li><li><strong>Verify your business:</strong> Verification is essential for trust. Google will send a postcard to your listed address or give you a call. Follow the instructions provided to complete this step.</li><li><strong>Regularly update your profile:</strong> After verification, keep your profile fresh and engaging by uploading high-quality photos of your products or services, showcasing special offers, and announcing any new services or events. For example, if you’re hosting a local art show or a tasting event at your restaurant, make sure to post about it!</li></ul>

Lisle residents often check ratings and read reviews on Google to gauge the quality of services or products. Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews, as this can significantly influence new customers.</li><li><strong>Looking at photos and posts:</strong> Before visiting a new place, potential customers frequently browse through photos and posts on your Google Business Profile.
