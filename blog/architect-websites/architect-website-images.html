 <h2>2. Architectural Photography Services</h2>

 <p>Hiring a professional architectural photographer can provide you with custom images tailored specifically to your projects. This approach allows you to showcase your work in the best light and capture the unique aspects of your designs. Here are some tips for working with a photographer:</p>

 <h2>4. Creative Commons & Public Domain Images</h2>

 <p>Creative Commons and public domain images can be a great source for free architectural images. However, it’s essential to respect the licensing agreements associated with these images. Here are some platforms to explore:</p>

 <p>3D renderings and visualizations can effectively showcase your architectural designs before they are built. This method allows potential clients to visualize the final product. Here are some tools and tips:</p>

 <p>- **Software Options**: Use tools like SketchUp, AutoCAD, or Blender to create detailed 3D models of your work.
- **Hire a Specialist**: If 3D modeling is not your forte, consider hiring a professional who specializes in architectural visualizations.
