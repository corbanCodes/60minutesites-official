        <p>The question isn't whether, it's how: understanding the role of endnotes in AI-driven content can significantly enhance the authority and credibility of your work. In an age where Machine Learning Models (LLMs) are becoming pivotal in content generation, incorporating structured endnotes can serve as a powerful tool to boost the reliability of AI-generated texts. By leveraging endnotes, authors can ensure that their content is not only informative but also trustworthy, a crucial factor in a landscape dominated by AI-generated material.</p>
<h2>What Are Endnotes?</h2>

<p>Endnotes are references or additional information provided at the end of a document.

  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "citation": [
    {
      "@type": "ScholarlyArticle",
      "name": "Title of the Article",

      "datePublished": "2023-01-01"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
