  "author": "Your Name",
  "datePublished": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "articleBody": "Content of your article"
}</code></pre><p>Incorporate this JSON-LD schema in your articles if possible, and ensure your LinkedIn profile is linked to your articles for credibility and to enhance the overall discoverability of your content.</p>

<h2>Promoting Your Articles for Maximum Reach</h2>

<p>To fully leverage your LinkedIn articles, promoting them across your network is essential. Consider the following strategies:</p><ul><li>Share articles in relevant LinkedIn groups to reach a targeted audience interested in your content.</li><li>Tag industry influencers in your posts to encourage them to share your content, thereby expanding your reach.</li><li>Repurpose excerpts of your articles for LinkedIn posts to drive traffic back to the full article, creating a cohesive content strategy.</li></ul>
