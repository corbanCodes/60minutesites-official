    # Upgrade the model to the latest version
    new_model = old_model.upgrade()
    return new_model

# Example usage:
old_model = load_model('v1.0')
new_model = upgrade_model(old_model)</code></pre><ul><li>Provide examples for both simple and complex use cases to cater to a broad audience.</li><li>Ensure code is properly commented for clarity, helping users follow along easily.</li></ul>
