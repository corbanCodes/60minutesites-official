        <p>A photography website needs more than beautiful images to book clients. Each page serves a specific purpose in moving visitors from casual browsers to paying customers. Understanding what pages you need and what content belongs on each helps you create a site that works as hard as you do.</p>

        <h2>The Core Pages Every Photographer Needs</h2>

        <h3>Homepage</h3>

        <p>Your homepage is the front door to your photography business. Most visitors land here first, and you have seconds to convince them to explore further. This page must accomplish three things immediately: demonstrate your photographic quality, establish what type of photography you offer, and provide clear paths forward.</p>

        <h4>What to Include</h4>

        <p><strong>Hero imagery:</strong> Lead with your absolute strongest work. A single powerful image or a curated grid of three to six images that immediately communicate quality and style.</p>

        <p><strong>Brief introduction:</strong> One or two sentences about who you are and what you photograph. Location and specialty should be clear within seconds.</p>

        <p><strong>Navigation:</strong> Obvious links to your portfolio, about page, and contact. Visitors should never wonder where to go next.</p>

        <p><strong>Call-to-action:</strong> An invitation to view your work or get in touch. "View Portfolio" and "Book Your Session" buttons give visitors clear next steps.</p>

        <h4>Common Mistakes</h4>

        <p>Avoid welcome screens or splash pages that add clicks before content. Do not autoplay music or video. Keep text minimal; let images do the heavy lifting. Do not feature mediocre images just because they are recent.</p>

        <h3>Portfolio or Gallery Pages</h3>

        <p>This is where your photography website lives or dies. Portfolio pages showcase your work in curated collections that demonstrate capabilities and style. How you organize and present these galleries determines how visitors perceive your work.</p>

        <h4>Organization Options</h4>

        <p><strong>By category:</strong> Weddings, portraits, events, commercial work. This works well for photographers with multiple specialties, helping visitors find relevant examples quickly.</p>

        <p><strong>By project:</strong> Individual weddings, sessions, or assignments. This works well for wedding photographers and others whose work tells stories best viewed as complete sets.</p>

        <p><strong>By style:</strong> Black and white, editorial, documentary. This can work for photographers with distinctive aesthetic approaches.</p>

        <h4>What to Include</h4>

        <p>Only your best work. Quality over quantity always. Fifteen exceptional images create more impact than fifty mixed ones. Each image should represent work you want to continue booking.</p>

        <p>Consider adding brief project context for work that benefits from explanation. Location, project type, or a sentence about the story can add meaning without overwhelming.</p>

        <h4>Technical Requirements</h4>

        <p>Images must load quickly. Optimize files without sacrificing visible quality. Include lightbox or full-screen viewing options. Ensure galleries work beautifully on mobile devices.</p>

        <h3>About Page</h3>

        <p>Photography clients are not just buying images; they are choosing to work with a person, often during important moments. Your about page helps visitors connect with you and understand your approach.</p>

        <h4>What to Include</h4>

        <p><strong>Your story:</strong> How you came to photography, what drives your work, and what you love about it. Write authentically rather than trying to impress.</p>

        <p><strong>Your approach:</strong> How you work with clients. Are you directive or documentary? Formal or casual? What can clients expect from the experience?</p>

        <p><strong>Professional background:</strong> Relevant experience, training, or recognition. Keep this brief unless your credentials are central to your market positioning.</p>

        <p><strong>Personal touches:</strong> A few details that help visitors know you as a person. This builds the connection that often tips decisions in competitive markets.</p>

        <p><strong>A photo of yourself:</strong> Clients want to see who they will be working with. Include a professional, personality-appropriate photo.</p>

        <h4>Writing Tips</h4>

        <p>Write in first person. Let your personality come through. Match your writing voice to your photography style. A playful portrait photographer writes differently than a dramatic fine art photographer.</p>

        <h3>Services Page</h3>

        <p>Potential clients need to understand what you offer before they reach out. A clear services page answers their questions and qualifies leads before they contact you.</p>

        <h4>What to Include</h4>

        <p><strong>Types of photography offered:</strong> List and briefly describe each service type. Wedding coverage, portrait sessions, commercial projects, and so on.</p>

        <p><strong>What is included:</strong> For each service, explain what clients receive. Coverage time, number of edited images, delivery format and timeline, rights granted.</p>

        <p><strong>The process:</strong> Walk through how booking and working together typically unfolds. What happens after they inquire? How should they prepare?</p>

        <p><strong>Service area:</strong> Where you work and any travel considerations. Save yourself from inquiries outside your geographic reach.</p>

        <h3>Pricing Page</h3>

        <p>Whether to display pricing publicly is debatable, but some pricing context helps visitors self-qualify before reaching out. Without any price indication, you will receive many inquiries from clients outside your budget range.</p>

        <h4>Displaying Full Pricing</h4>

        <p>If you show packages, present them clearly with what is included at each level. Use visual hierarchy to guide attention. Consider highlighting a recommended option. Make it easy to compare tiers.</p>

        <h4>Starting Price Approach</h4>

        <p>If full packages do not suit your business model, display starting prices instead. "Wedding coverage from $3,500" or "Portrait sessions starting at $350" gives context without committing to specific offerings.</p>

        <h4>Inquiry-Required Approach</h4>

        <p>If you prefer not to display prices, at least indicate the general range or market position. "Custom investment based on your needs" tells visitors nothing. "Premium photography for discerning clients" signals positioning without numbers.</p>

        <h3>Contact Page</h3>

        <p>When someone decides they want to work with you, the contact page must make reaching out effortless. Every obstacle costs you potential bookings.</p>

        <h4>What to Include</h4>

        <p><strong>Contact form:</strong> Name, email, phone (optional), type of session or project, date if relevant, message. Keep it short. Every additional required field reduces completion rates.</p>

        <p><strong>Direct contact:</strong> Email address and phone number for those who prefer not to use forms.</p>

        <p><strong>Response time:</strong> Set expectations. "I respond to all inquiries within 48 hours" manages client expectations and demonstrates professionalism.</p>

        <p><strong>Service area reminder:</strong> Confirm the locations you serve to prevent out-of-area inquiries.</p>

        <h2>Additional Pages to Consider</h2>

        <h3>Blog</h3>

        <p>A blog can help with search visibility and provide content to share. Session features, location guides, and helpful client information are common approaches.</p>

        <p>However, only commit to a blog if you will maintain it. An abandoned blog with one post from years ago looks worse than no blog. If you cannot post at least monthly, skip it.</p>

        <h3>FAQ Page</h3>

        <p>Frequently asked questions address common inquiries before they reach your inbox. This saves time and demonstrates that you understand client concerns. Questions about booking process, what to wear, cancellation policies, and delivery timelines are typical.</p>

        <h3>Client Resources</h3>

        <p>Some photographers create dedicated pages with preparation guides, location suggestions, or styling tips. These add value for potential clients and position you as helpful and thorough.</p>

        <h3>Testimonials or Reviews</h3>

        <p>Social proof from past clients builds trust. A dedicated testimonials page or reviews integrated throughout your site help visitors feel confident about booking.</p>

        <h2>Page Structure Principles</h2>

        <h3>Consistent Navigation</h3>

        <p>Use the same navigation structure across all pages. Visitors should always know where they are and how to get elsewhere. Contact options should appear on every page, not just the contact page.</p>

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

        <p>Most important information comes first. Use headings to break up content. Make calls-to-action visually prominent. Guide visitors through content logically.</p>

        <h3>Mobile Considerations</h3>

        <p>Every page must work on mobile devices. Test navigation, forms, and content at phone screen sizes. Mobile visitors should have an experience as polished as desktop visitors.</p>

        <h3>Speed Optimization</h3>

        <p>Each page should load quickly. Optimize images. Minimize unnecessary elements. Test with speed analysis tools and address any issues identified.</p>
