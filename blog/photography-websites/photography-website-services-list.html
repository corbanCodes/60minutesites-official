 <p>- **Categorize Services**: Group similar services together (e.g., all wedding-related services in one section).

 <h2>Including Visuals</h2>

 <p>Photography is a visual medium, so make sure to include high-quality images that represent your work. Consider the following:</p>

 <p>- **Sample Galleries**: Include a small gallery for each service to showcase your portfolio.

- **Behind-the-Scenes Images**: This can help potential clients feel more connected to your process.</p>

 <h2>SEO Optimization for Your Services Page</h2>

- **Meta Descriptions**: Write a compelling meta description that summarizes your services.
- **Alt Text for Images**: Include descriptive alt text for all images to improve search engine visibility.</p>

 <h2>Creating a Call to Action (CTA)</h2>

 <p>Every services page should have a clear call to action. Consider these options:</p>

 <p>- **Contact Form**: Include a simple form for inquiries.
- **Booking Button**: Allow clients to schedule sessions directly from the page.
