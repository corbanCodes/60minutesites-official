 <p>DIY website builders advertise low monthly prices that make creating a website seem almost free. The reality is more complicated. Once you factor in upgrades needed for a professional site, additional services, and the value of your time, DIY is not as cheap as it appears.</p>

 <p>This article breaks down what Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, and other builders actually cost when you include everything needed for a legitimate business website.</p>

 <h2>Major DIY Builder Pricing Comparison</h2>

 <p>Pricing as of early 2026. All builders offer free tiers with significant limitations that make them unsuitable for business use.</p>

 <h3>Wix Pricing</h3>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Light:</strong> $17/month - Connect your domain, remove Wix ads, 2GB storage</li>
 <li><strong>Core:</strong> $29/month - More storage, basic e-commerce features, analytics</li>
 <li><strong>Business:</strong> $36/month - Full e-commerce, subscriptions, automated sales tax</li>
 <li><strong>Business Elite:</strong> $159/month - Advanced features, priority support</li>
 </ul>

 <p>For a basic business site without e-commerce, the Core plan at $29/month ($348/year) is typically the minimum practical option.</p>

 <h3>Squarespace Pricing</h3>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Personal:</strong> $16/month - Basic features, no e-commerce</li>
 <li><strong>Business:</strong> $23/month - E-commerce with 3% transaction fee, promotional popups</li>
 <li><strong>Commerce Basic:</strong> $28/month - No transaction fees, sell unlimited products</li>
 <li><strong>Commerce Advanced:</strong> $52/month - Advanced commerce features</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The Business plan at $23/month ($276/year) serves most small business needs.</p>

 <h3>Weebly Pricing</h3>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Free:</strong> $0 - Weebly subdomain, Weebly ads, limited features</li>
 <li><strong>Personal:</strong> $10/month - Connect domain, no ads</li>
 <li><strong>Professional:</strong> $12/month - Site search, password protection</li>
 <li><strong>Performance:</strong> $26/month - E-commerce without transaction fees</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The Professional plan at $12/month ($144/year) is the minimum for professional use. Weebly tends to be less polished than Wix or Squarespace.</p>

 <h3>WordPress.com Pricing</h3>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Free:</strong> $0 - WordPress.com subdomain, ads on your site</li>
 <li><strong>Personal:</strong> $4/month - Custom domain, no ads</li>
 <li><strong>Premium:</strong> $8/month - Advanced design, monetization tools</li>
 <li><strong>Business:</strong> $25/month - Plugin access, advanced SEO</li>
 <li><strong>Commerce:</strong> $45/month - Full e-commerce</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Note: WordPress.com is different from self-hosted WordPress.org. For real flexibility, most people need at least the Business plan at $25/month ($300/year).</p>

 <h2>Additional Costs Most People Forget</h2>

 <p>The monthly plan price is just the beginning. Add these common expenses:</p>

 <h3>Domain Name</h3>

 <p>Some builders include a free domain for the first year, but expect to pay $15-$50/year for domain registration after that. Premium domain names cost more.</p>

 <h3>Premium Templates</h3>

 <p>While most builders include free templates, premium templates with more features or better design cost $50-$200 one-time.</p>

 <h3>Apps and Add-ons</h3>

 <p>Want specific functionality? Many useful features require paid apps:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Advanced contact forms: $5-$15/month</li>
 <li>Booking and scheduling: $10-$30/month</li>
 <li>Email marketing integration: $10-$50/month</li>
 <li>Advanced analytics: $10-$30/month</li>
 <li>Review widgets: $5-$20/month</li>
 </ul>

 <p>A few apps can easily add $50-$100/month to your total cost.</p>

 <h3>Stock Photos and Graphics</h3>

 <p>Unless you have good photos of your own, expect to buy stock images. Quality images cost $10-$50 each, or stock subscriptions run $15-$50/month.</p>

 <h3>Email</h3>

 <p>Professional email using your domain (you@yourbusiness.com) is not included. Google Workspace costs $6/user/month. Microsoft 365 starts at $6/user/month.</p>

 <h2>The Hidden Cost: Your Time</h2>

 <p>This is where DIY website builders become expensive even though they seem cheap.</p>

 <p>Building a basic five-page business website yourself typically requires:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>Learning the platform: 5-15 hours</li>
 <li>Designing and building pages: 10-30 hours</li>
 <li>Writing content: 5-15 hours</li>
 <li>Finding and optimizing images: 3-10 hours</li>
 <li>Troubleshooting issues: 5-15 hours</li>
 <li>Revisions and refinements: 5-20 hours</li>
 </ul>

 <p><strong>Total: 33-105 hours</strong> for most people without web design experience.</p>

 <p>At a modest $50/hour value for your time (what you could earn doing actual business work), that time investment represents $1,650-$5,250 in opportunity cost.</p>

 <p>Suddenly that "cheap" DIY website is not so cheap.</p>

 <h2>Real First-Year Cost Examples</h2>

 <p>Here is what DIY actually costs for common scenarios.</p>

 <h3>Scenario 1: Absolute Minimum Business Site</h3>

 <ul>
 <li>Squarespace Business plan: $276/year</li>
 <li>Domain: $15/year</li>
 <li>Time investment: 40 hours at $50/hour = $2,000</li>
 </ul>

 <p><strong>Total real cost: $2,291</strong> (only $291 in cash)</p>

 <h3>Scenario 2: Professional Small Business Site</h3>

 <ul>
 <li>Wix Core plan: $348/year</li>
 <li>Domain: $15/year</li>
 <li>Premium template: $100</li>
 <li>Booking app: $15/month = $180/year</li>
 <li>Stock photos: $150</li>
 <li>Google Workspace email: $72/year</li>
 <li>Time investment: 60 hours at $50/hour = $3,000</li>
 </ul>

 <p><strong>Total real cost: $3,865</strong> ($865 in cash)</p>

 <h3>Scenario 3: E-commerce Store</h3>

 <ul>
 <li>Squarespace Commerce Basic: $336/year</li>
 <li>Domain: $15/year</li>
 <li>Shipping label app: $120/year</li>
 <li>Inventory management app: $180/year</li>
 <li>Stock photos: $200</li>
 <li>Email: $72/year</li>
 <li>Time investment: 100 hours at $50/hour = $5,000</li>
 </ul>

 <p><strong>Total real cost: $5,923</strong> ($923 in cash)</p>

 <h2>When DIY Makes Sense</h2>

 <p>DIY website builders can be appropriate in certain situations:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>You genuinely enjoy learning new technology</li>
 <li>Your time is not billable or revenue-generating</li>
 <li>You have design sensibility and can produce professional results</li>
 <li>Your business is a side project or hobby</li>
 <li>You are testing an idea and need something temporary</li>
 <li>Cash flow is extremely tight and time is your only available resource</li>
 </ul>

 <p>For these situations, DIY can work well. The cash cost is genuinely low, and if you value the learning experience, the time is not wasted.</p>

 <h2>When DIY Does Not Make Sense</h2>

 <p>DIY is usually not the best choice when:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>Your time generates revenue for your business</li>
 <li>You need professional results but lack design skills</li>
 <li>You want a website working quickly rather than "someday"</li>
 <li>Technical problem-solving frustrates rather than interests you</li>
 <li>Your website is important to your business credibility</li>
 <li>You have tried DIY before and it did not work out</li>
 </ul>

 <p>In these cases, paying for professional help usually delivers better results and actually saves money when you account for time.</p>

 <h2>Alternatives to Pure DIY</h2>

 <p>If DIY appeals to you but the time investment does not, consider middle-ground options:</p>

 <p><strong>Template-based services:</strong> Someone else handles setup and customization using professional templates. You provide content. Lower cost than custom development, much faster than DIY. Typical cost: $500-$1,500/year.</p>

 <p><strong>Freelancer for initial setup:</strong> Hire someone to build the initial site using a DIY builder, then manage updates yourself. One-time cost plus ongoing builder subscription. Typical cost: $500-$2,000 setup plus $200-$400/year ongoing.</p>

 <p><strong>Managed WordPress:</strong> WordPress with professional setup, hosting, and maintenance handled for you. More control than builders, less work than self-managed WordPress. Typical cost: $50-$150/month.</p>

 <h2>The Bottom Line on DIY Website Cost</h2>

 <p>DIY website builders are not free, and they are not even particularly cheap once you factor in the real costs. Monthly fees of $15-$50 become $180-$600/year. Add apps, photos, email, and domain for another $200-$500/year. Factor in 30-100 hours of your time at even modest rates and the "cheap" option costs $2,000-$6,000 in real terms.</p>

 <p>If you have more time than money and enjoy the process, DIY can work. If you have any reasonable budget and value your time, paying someone to handle it often delivers better results at lower actual cost.</p>

 <p>Be honest about what your time is worth and what results you can actually achieve. The cheapest option is rarely the best value.</p>
