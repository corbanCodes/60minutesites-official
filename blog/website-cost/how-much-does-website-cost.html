        <p>Search for website pricing and you will find answers ranging from "free" to "hundreds of thousands of dollars." Both are technically accurate, which is not particularly helpful when you are trying to plan a budget. This article cuts through the noise with real pricing information for 2026.</p>

        <p>The short answer: most small business websites cost between $500 and $5,000 in the first year, with ongoing costs of $50-$200 per month. But where you land in that range depends on the approach you choose and the complexity of your needs.</p>

        <h2>Website Cost by Approach</h2>

        <p>There are four main ways to get a website. Each has different cost structures, trade-offs, and ideal use cases.</p>

        <h3>DIY Website Builders</h3>

        <p>Platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly let you build a website yourself using drag-and-drop tools. No coding required, but significant time investment expected.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical costs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free tiers available with major limitations (ads, subdomain)</li>
          <li>Basic paid plans: $12-$23/month</li>
          <li>Business plans: $27-$49/month</li>
          <li>E-commerce plans: $27-$59/month</li>
          <li>Domain: $10-$20/year additional</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>First year total:</strong> $150-$700 depending on plan level</p>

        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Hosting included, templates to customize, basic features, you handle all design and content work.</p>

        <p><strong>What you give up:</strong> 20-80+ hours of your time learning and building, results that often look amateur, limited functionality, you are responsible for everything.</p>

        <h3>Template-Based Services</h3>

        <p>Services that use pre-designed templates but handle the setup, customization, and technical details for you. You get professional results without the DIY learning curve.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical costs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monthly fees: $30-$200/month</li>
          <li>Setup fees: $0-$500 one-time</li>
          <li>Domain: sometimes included, otherwise $10-$20/year</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>First year total:</strong> $400-$2,500</p>

        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Professional design, hosting included, someone else handles technical setup, faster launch (often days instead of weeks), ongoing support and maintenance.</p>

        <p><strong>What you give up:</strong> Extensive customization beyond template capabilities, unique design that no one else has.</p>

        <h3>Freelance Web Designers</h3>

        <p>Hiring an individual designer or developer to create your website. Quality and pricing vary enormously.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical costs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple sites: $1,000-$3,000</li>
          <li>Standard business sites: $3,000-$8,000</li>
          <li>Complex sites: $8,000-$15,000+</li>
          <li>Hosting: $10-$50/month additional</li>
          <li>Maintenance: $50-$200/month if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>First year total:</strong> $1,500-$18,000+</p>

        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> More customization, working with a professional, potentially unique design.</p>

        <p><strong>What you give up:</strong> Higher cost, project timelines of weeks to months, risk of working with unreliable freelancers, ongoing support depends on your arrangement.</p>

        <h3>Web Design Agencies</h3>

        <p>Full-service companies with teams of designers, developers, and project managers. Higher cost but more comprehensive service.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical costs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small business sites: $5,000-$15,000</li>
          <li>Mid-size projects: $15,000-$50,000</li>
          <li>Large or complex projects: $50,000-$200,000+</li>
          <li>Hosting and maintenance: additional monthly fees</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>First year total:</strong> $7,000-$250,000+</p>

        <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Professional process, multiple specialists, custom design and development, project management, typically higher quality and reliability.</p>

        <p><strong>What you give up:</strong> Significant budget, longer timelines, may be overkill for simple needs.</p>

        <h2>What Affects Website Cost</h2>

        <p>Understanding cost drivers helps you evaluate quotes and make appropriate decisions.</p>

        <h3>Complexity of Design</h3>

        <p>A simple, clean design based on a template costs far less than a completely custom design created from scratch. Custom illustrations, animations, and unique layouts require more designer time and cost more.</p>

        <h3>Number of Pages</h3>

        <p>More pages mean more design and development work. A five-page site costs less than a fifty-page site. However, page count alone is not the only complexity factor.</p>

        <h3>Functionality Requirements</h3>

        <p>These features add significant cost:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>E-commerce with shopping carts</li>
          <li>Member login and user accounts</li>
          <li>Booking and scheduling systems</li>
          <li>Custom calculators or tools</li>
          <li>Database-driven content</li>
          <li>Integration with other software</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content Creation</h3>

        <p>Many quotes assume you provide all text and images. If you need professional copywriting ($100-$500 per page) or photography ($500-$3,000+), add those costs to your budget.</p>

        <h3>Who Does the Work</h3>

        <p>Higher rates reflect experience, location, and overhead. A designer in San Francisco charges more than one in a small town. An agency with an office and staff charges more than a solo freelancer working from home.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Down First-Year Costs</h2>

        <p>To fairly compare options, calculate first-year total cost including all expenses.</p>

        <p><strong>DIY Builder Example (Wix Business Plan):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plan: $27/month x 12 = $324</li>
          <li>Domain: $15/year</li>
          <li>Your time: 40 hours at $50/hour equivalent = $2,000</li>
          <li>Total: $2,339 (but only $339 in actual cash spent)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Template Service Example (60 Minute Sites Annual):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Annual plan: $500</li>
          <li>Domain: $15/year</li>
          <li>Your time: 2 hours for onboarding = $100 equivalent</li>
          <li>Total: $615</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Freelancer Example (Mid-range project):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design and development: $4,000</li>
          <li>Hosting: $30/month x 12 = $360</li>
          <li>Domain: $15</li>
          <li>Your time managing project: 10 hours = $500 equivalent</li>
          <li>Total: $4,875</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Agency Example (Small business project):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design and development: $12,000</li>
          <li>Hosting: $100/month x 12 = $1,200</li>
          <li>Domain: $15</li>
          <li>Maintenance retainer: $150/month x 12 = $1,800</li>
          <li>Total: $15,015</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Right Choice for Common Situations</h2>

        <p>Different situations call for different approaches. Here is what typically makes sense:</p>

        <h3>Tight Budget, Simple Needs</h3>

        <p>If you have more time than money and need a basic website, DIY builders can work. Expect to invest significant time learning the platform and building something passable. Template services offer better results for slightly more money and far less time.</p>

        <h3>Small Business, Standard Website</h3>

        <p>Most small businesses need a straightforward site showing who they are, what they do, and how to contact them. Template-based services excel here, providing professional results at reasonable cost. Spending $10,000+ on custom development rarely makes sense for this use case.</p>

        <h3>E-commerce Store</h3>

        <p>Online selling adds complexity. Simple stores with few products can use Shopify ($29-$299/month) or similar platforms. Complex e-commerce with inventory management, multiple payment methods, and custom functionality may justify custom development.</p>

        <h3>Unique Functionality Needs</h3>

        <p>If your website needs to do something specific that off-the-shelf solutions cannot handle, custom development becomes necessary. This is expensive but sometimes the only path to what you need.</p>

        <h3>Large Organization or Enterprise</h3>

        <p>Larger organizations with complex requirements, multiple stakeholders, and strict compliance needs typically require agency-level service and budget.</p>

        <h2>Questions to Ask Before Committing</h2>

        <p>Before choosing any approach, get clear answers to these questions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What is included in the quoted price?</li>
          <li>What is not included that I might need?</li>
          <li>Who provides hosting and what does it cost?</li>
          <li>What happens if I want changes after launch?</li>
          <li>Who owns the website files?</li>
          <li>What happens if I want to move to a different provider?</li>
          <li>What is the timeline from start to launch?</li>
          <li>What do I need to provide (content, images, etc.)?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Website costs vary based on what you need and who does the work. For most small businesses, the sweet spot is $500-$2,000 in the first year with a template-based service or modest DIY investment. Custom development makes sense when you have specific needs that templates cannot address and budget to support the investment.</p>

        <p>Do not overspend on capabilities you do not need. A $500 website that effectively represents your business and generates leads delivers better return than a $15,000 custom site that does the same thing with fancier animations.</p>

        <p>Equally, do not underspend to the point of damaging your credibility. A free website with builder ads and a generic subdomain may cost your business more in lost customers than the money you saved.</p>

        <p>Match your investment to your actual needs, plan for ongoing costs, and choose an approach that fits your available time and budget.</p>
