 <h2>Understanding the Components of Website Costs</h2>

 <p>The cost of a website can vary widely based on several factors. Here are the primary components that contribute to the overall cost:</p>

3. **Website Design**: Custom website design can range from $1,000 to over $10,000, depending on complexity and the designer's expertise. Templates and DIY website builders can reduce costs, starting around $100.
4. **Development Costs**: If you require custom features or functionalities, development costs can add significantly to your budget. Freelance developers may charge between $50 to $150 per hour.
5. **Content Creation**: High-quality content is essential. Hiring a content writer may cost between $50 to $500 for a single page, depending on expertise and length.
