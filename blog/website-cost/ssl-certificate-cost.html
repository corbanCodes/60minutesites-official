An SSL certificate can give your site a boost in rankings, making it easier for potential customers to find you.</li></ul>

Well-known providers like VeriSign or DigiCert may charge more due to their established trustworthiness and customer support.</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> Purchasing a certificate for multiple years can often lead to significant savings. Many providers offer discounts for long-term commitments, so it’s worth considering a longer duration to save money.</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> Additional services such as malware scanning, vulnerability assessments, and warranty offerings can increase the price of your SSL certificate but may provide added peace of mind.</li></ul>
