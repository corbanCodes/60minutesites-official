 <h2>Why Add Google Maps to Your Cleaning Website?</h2>

 <p>Integrating Google Maps into your cleaning website offers several benefits. Here are some key reasons why you should consider this addition:</p>

 <p>1. **Enhanced Visibility:** Google Maps makes it easier for potential customers to find your cleaning service, especially when they are searching for local businesses.

 <p>### Step 3: Embed the Code in Your Website
- Log in to your website’s content management system (CMS) or HTML editor.

 <h2>Best Practices for Using Google Maps on Your Cleaning Website</h2>

 <p>To maximize the effectiveness of Google Maps on your cleaning website, consider the following best practices:</p>

2. **Keep Your Business Information Updated:** Ensure your business location and contact details are current on Google My Business, as this information will reflect on your map.
3. **Optimize Your Website for Mobile:** Many users will access your website via mobile devices. Make sure the embedded map is responsive and looks good on smaller screens.
