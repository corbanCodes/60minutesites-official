 <p>- **Keyword Research**: Identify keywords related to your cleaning services, such as 'cleaning services near me,' 'residential cleaning,' or 'commercial cleaning'.
- **On-Page SEO**: Incorporate keywords naturally into your content, titles, headings, and meta descriptions. Ensure that your website's structure is clean and easy to navigate.
- **Local SEO**: Claim your Google My Business listing and optimize it with your business name, address, phone number, and service details to appear in local searches.</p>

 <p>Consider using a checklist for your SEO efforts:</p>

- **Navigation**: Create an easy-to-use navigation menu that allows visitors to find information quickly.
