 <p>Creating a website for your cleaning business doesn't have to break the bank. With a plethora of free cleaning website templates available online, small business owners can establish a professional online presence without the hefty price tag.

Understanding what to look for when selecting a free cleaning website template is crucial to ensure your website effectively showcases your services and attracts potential clients. In this article, we will explore the essential features and elements to consider, along with a checklist to guide you in your selection process.</p>
 <h2>Responsive Design</h2>

 <p>Having a responsive website is crucial. A responsive design ensures that your website looks great and functions well on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
