        <p>Understanding the pricing structure of Squarespace is essential for small business owners. Below is a breakdown of the Squarespace pricing plans as of 2023:</p>

        <p>| Plan Name            | Monthly Cost (Billed Annually) | Key Features                                                              |

3. **Cost**: For barbers on a tight budget, the monthly fees can add up, especially if they require advanced features.
4. **Transaction Fees**: For the Business plan, there is a 3% transaction fee on sales, which can eat into profits for barber businesses selling products.
