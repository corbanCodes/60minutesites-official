 <p>Creating a successful mortgage website requires careful planning and consideration of the essential pages that will provide valuable information to your visitors and help convert them into leads. Each page must serve a specific purpose, guiding the user through their mortgage journey. This article will outline the key pages a mortgage website needs to effectively serve its audience and drive business growth.</p>
 <h2>1. Home Page</h2>

- Contact information or a contact form</p>

 <p>The goal of the home page is to engage visitors and encourage them to explore further.</p>

- Company history
- Mission statement
- Team bios and photos to personalize your brand
- Any relevant certifications or affiliations</p>

 <p>Visitors want to know who they are dealing with, and this page can help humanize your business.</p>

- Eligibility requirements
- Links to detailed articles or resources for more information</p>

 <p>This page helps clients understand which mortgage product may be best suited for their needs.</p>

- Explanations of each input field and how to use the calculator effectively</p>

 <p>By providing this tool, you can attract users who are in the research phase of their mortgage journey.</p>

 <p>This page should be clear and straightforward to facilitate the application process.</p>
