2. **Client Engagement**: With features like reviews and Q&A, you can interact with potential clients, answer their questions, and build trust.
3. **Showcase Your Work**: You can upload photos of past events, share client testimonials, and highlight your services, which can influence a client’s decision to reach out to you.
4. **Operational Information**: Your GBP can provide essential information such as your business hours, location, and contact details, ensuring potential clients can reach you easily.</p>

 <p>By effectively setting up your Google Business Profile, you can position your event planning business for success.</p>
