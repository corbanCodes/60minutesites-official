 <p>✓ Prominent contact details: Display your phone number, email address, and physical address on every page.
✓ Contact form: Include a simple form for inquiries, ensuring it requires minimal information from users.
✓ Live chat option: Consider integrating a live chat feature for instant communication.</p>
