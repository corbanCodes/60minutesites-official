 <p>- **Keyword Research**: Use relevant keywords, like "roofing services" or "roof repair," throughout your website content.
- **Quality Content**: Publish informative blog posts or articles that answer common roofing questions.

 <p>- **Prominent Display**: Feature testimonials on your homepage or a dedicated testimonials page.

 <p>- **SSL Certificate**: Ensure your website has an SSL certificate to protect user data and improve SEO rankings.
- **Optimize Images**: Compress images to reduce loading times without sacrificing quality.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Regularly update your website software and plugins to keep it running smoothly.</p>

 <p>### Checklist:
