- **On-Page SEO**: Ensure that your target keywords are included in key areas such as the title tag, meta description, headers, and throughout the content.
- **Image Optimization**: Use descriptive file names for your images and include alt text to help search engines understand what the images are about. This is especially important for flooring websites that rely heavily on visuals.
- **Internal Linking**: Link to other relevant pages on your site to help search engines crawl your site more effectively and improve user navigation.</p>
