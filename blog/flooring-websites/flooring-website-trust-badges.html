 <p>Trust is paramount, especially for flooring websites that offer a significant investment. Trust badges serve as visual cues that reassure customers about the legitimacy and security of a website. This article will delve into what trust badges are, their importance for flooring websites, and how to effectively implement them to boost customer confidence and increase conversions.

 <h2>What Are Trust Badges?</h2>

 <p>Trust badges are symbols or graphics displayed on a website that indicate the site meets certain security, privacy, or quality standards.

They address common concerns that shoppers may have when making a significant investment in products like flooring.</p>
