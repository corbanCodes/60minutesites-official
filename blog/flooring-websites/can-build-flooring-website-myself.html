 <h2>Understanding the Basics of Website Development</h2>

3. **Content Management System (CMS)**: A CMS allows you to create, manage, and modify content on your website without needing to know how to code. Popular options include WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace.
4. **Responsive Design**: Your website should be mobile-friendly, meaning it should function well on both desktop and mobile devices.
