 <h2>2. Utilize Strong Call-to-Actions (CTAs)</h2>

 <p>A strong call-to-action (CTA) is essential for guiding visitors toward taking the desired action, whether it’s filling out a contact form, requesting a quote, or calling your business. Here are some tips for creating effective CTAs on your landing page:
