In this article, we will explore the differences between a landscaping website and a Google Business Profile, providing insights into how each can benefit your business. We will also include a checklist to help you determine the best approach for your needs.</p>
 <h2>Understanding Landscaping Websites</h2>

 <p>A landscaping website serves as a central hub for your business, providing detailed information about your services, portfolio, and contact information. Here are some key features of a landscaping website:</p>

6. **Photos and Videos**: You can upload photos and videos of your projects, offering potential clients a visual representation of your work.
7. **Q&A Feature**: Customers can ask questions directly on your profile, and you can provide answers, which helps build trust and engagement.</p>
