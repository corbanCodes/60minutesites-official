For example, a photographer might want to know the type of event, date, and location for a booking inquiry.</li><li><strong>Lead Management:</strong> They help manage leads efficiently, especially for small businesses. By categorizing inquiries through different forms, you can prioritize responses based on urgency or significance.</li><li><strong>Professional Image:</strong> Having a form can enhance your website's credibility and professionalism.
