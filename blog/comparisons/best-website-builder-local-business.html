Great visuals can significantly enhance the appeal of your website and encourage visitors to explore further.</li><li><strong>Ensure your navigation is straightforward</strong>: A clean, intuitive navigation structure makes it easy for visitors to find what they need quickly. Use clear labels for menu items and consider including a search feature for larger sites.</li><li><strong>Incorporate calls-to-action</strong>: Encourage local customers to engage with your business by including clear calls-to-action (CTAs).
