        <p>When it comes to creating a website for your massage therapy business, choosing the right platform can make a significant difference in terms of functionality, aesthetics, and ease of use. Among the most popular website building platforms, WordPress and Wix stand out due to their unique features and capabilities. This article will explore the pros and cons of each platform specifically for massage websites, helping you make an informed decision that aligns with your business needs.</p>
        <h2>Overview of WordPress and Wix</h2>

        <p>WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) that powers over 40% of the internet. It provides users with an extensive library of themes and plugins, making it highly customizable. On the other hand, Wix is a cloud-based website builder known for its user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to create visually appealing websites without extensive technical knowledge. Both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses, particularly when it comes to building websites for massage therapists.</p>

        <h2>Customization and Design Flexibility</h2>
