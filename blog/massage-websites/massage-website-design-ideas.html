Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to revamp your existing site, these ideas will guide you in building a website that reflects your brand and meets customer needs.</p>
 <h2>Understanding Your Target Audience</h2>

 <p>Before diving into design ideas, it's essential to understand who your target audience is. Your website should cater to their preferences and needs. Consider the following aspects:</p>
