 <p>Having a strong online presence is crucial for small business owners, especially in the wellness industry. A massage website that is mobile-friendly not only enhances user experience but also plays a significant role in search engine rankings. With more users accessing websites from their smartphones and tablets, ensuring that your massage website is optimized for mobile devices is no longer optional.

 <h2>Understanding Mobile-Friendliness</h2>
