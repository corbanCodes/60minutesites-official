        <h2>Understanding Your Audience</h2>

        <p>Before diving into the design aspects, it’s imperative to understand who your target audience is. Identifying your audience will guide your design choices and content strategy. Consider the following:  
- What are their demographics?  
- What problems are they trying to solve?  
- What information are they seeking?  
- How do they prefer to interact with businesses online?  
Gather data through surveys, social media, and analytics tools to better understand your audience. Additionally, create audience personas to visualize their needs and preferences.</p>

        <h2>Choosing the Right Platform</h2>
